do_awareness_intro1:
  title: This is just the beginning...
  body: For the next few days, let’s start by making you aware of some of the things you do every day.


    Be honest. No cheating. No judgments, no worries--just a little bit of work. Just, let us know a bit about what you’ve been up to...


    We just want you to know that we know this is a bit tedious.

    But bear with us. If you can keep this up for a few days it will be really helpful later.
