all_or_nothing:
  title: All-Or-Nothing Thinking
  description: You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance
    falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.

overgeneralization:
  title: Overgeneralization
  description: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.

mental_filter:
  title: Mental Filter
  description: You pick out a single negative defeat and dwell on it exclusively
    so that your vision of reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that
    colors the entire beaker of water.

disqual:
  title: Disqualifying the positive
  description: "You dismiss positive experiences by insisting they \"don't
    count\" for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative
    belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences."

jumping:
  title: Jumping to conclusions
  description: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no
    definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion.

magnification:
  title: Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization
  description: "You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or
    someone else's achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they
    appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow's
    imperfections). This is also called the \"binocular trick.\""

emotional:
  title: Emotional Reasoning
  description: "You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the
    way things really are: \"I feel it, therefore it must be true.\""

should:
  title: Should Statements
  description: "You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts, as if
    you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do
    anything. \"Musts\" and \"oughts\" are also offenders. The emotional
    consequence is guilt.

    When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger,
    frustration, and resentment."

labeling:
  title: Labeling and Mislabeling
  description: "This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of
    describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: \"I'm a
    loser.\" When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a
    negative label to him: \"He's a goddam louse\".

    Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly
    colored and emotionally loaded."

personalization:
  title: Personalization
  description: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event
    which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.
