"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",1,Welcome to ThinkFeelDo!,"As this is your first lesson, you'll learn:
- Why ThinkFeelDo might be helpful for you
- How ThinkFeelDo works"
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",2,Why should I use ThinkFeelDo?,"Our goal is to help you take control over your mood!  It's easy to get overwhelmed by stressful events or to let one bad day turn into a bad week or month.  ThinkFeelDo will teach you research supported techniques that will allow you to get control over your mood and better manage difficult situations.
 
By being prepared with the skills you need to stay in control, you can prevent yourself from experiencing depression.  You can also use the skills you learn to navigate tough times in a healthy way!  "
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",3,"Am I just having a bad day? Or is this depression?
","Sadness and stress are as much a part of the human experience as happiness and joy. However, it is important to know when your bad day has turned into something more, and that your feelings may be symptoms of depression.

The symptoms of depression are:
-  feeling consistently depressed or down,
-  feeling much less interested in doing or enjoying most things
-  having problems with your appetite or your sleep,
-  moving too slowly or feeling agitated and restless,
-  feeling tired all the time,
-  feeling guilty or worthless,
-  having difficulty concentrating, and
-  having thoughts of self harm or suicide.
 
When a person is feeling many of these symptoms consistently for the past 2 weeks, then he/she may be experiencing depression.
 
If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself or anyone else, we urge you to call your doctor to discuss treatment options, in addition to this program.  If you feel a strong urge to harm yourself or someone else, call 911, or, if you want to talk to someone, call 1-800-SUICIDE."
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",4,Depression is treatable,"Although the triggers and symptoms of depression may be different for everyone, there is one thing that is the same:  Depression is treatable. ThinkFeelDo is based on an approach called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Research has repeatedly shown this approach to be highly effective for treating depression and improving your wellbeing."
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",5,How does ThinkFeelDo work?,"The skills taught in ThinkFeelDo come from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT teaches that your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all related to each other.  If you change one, that impacts the others.  For example, when you feel sad or depressed, it changes both how you think (cognitions) and what you do (behaviors). Feeling sad can:
1.    Change your behavior by making it harder to get motivated. As a result, when you’re feeling down you probably do less.
2.    Make your thoughts more negative. Being sad or depressed leads to more negative thoughts about yourself (like ""I'm no good""), the people and world around you (like ""Nobody cares about me""), and the future (like ""Nothing will get better"")"
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",6,,"Your behavior can affect both your mood and your thoughts, for better or for worse. Doing less, or doing things that are not enjoyable, can make your thoughts more negative and leave you feeling worse.  For example, if you spend a day off of work by yourself not doing much of anything, you'll probably not feel very good at the end of the day, and you may end up thinking pretty negatively - like ""I'll never accomplish much"" or ""I'm such a loser for avoiding tough tasks""
 
Doing more, and doing things that give you some pleasure or sense of accomplishment will improve your mood and help you think more positively.  If, instead of spending a day alone doing nothing, you meet a friend for lunch and then go to a movie, you'll probably feel a little better, and your thoughts may be more positive - ""I have things to be happy about"" or ""I enjoy spending time with friends."""
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",7,,"How your thoughts impact your mood and your behavior:
-    Negative thoughts tend to make you disengage and can leave you feeling worse.  If you face a problem thinking ""This will never work out,"" you will be less likely to even try to fix the problem. And the situation will continue and you will end up feeling worse.
-    On the other hand, adopting a more helpful attitude can increase the chances of success.  If you face the same problem with a thought like ""This is tough, but I will at least be able to improve things a little"" you will probably try to do more, and will end up feeling better."
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",8,,"What to expect:
ThinkFeelDo is a 12-week program and consists of several pieces to help you use the program:
1)    LESSONS (accessed by clicking the ""learn"" button) help you understand concepts to help you overcome depression
2)    TOOLS (accessed by clicking the ""feel"", ""do"", and ""think"" buttons) assist you in putting the concepts you’ve learned in the lessons into practice. Not all tools are available when you start this program. 
3)    GUIDES (accessed within each tool by clicking ""Launch Guides"") teach you how to use the tools and how they can be helpful
4)   MY COACH (accessed by clicking the ""My Coach"" button on the right-hand side of the screen) is the place to communicate with your coach and receive support and encouragement"
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",9,Getting Started,"We’ve created two tools to help you use the concepts on ThinkFeelDo throughout your day. These tools are the Activity Tracker (""Do"") and the Thought Tracker (""Think""). Each tool relates to a part of the ideas that make up Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. The Activity Tracker helps you learn from and change your behaviors, whereas, the Thought Tracker helps you learn from and change your thoughts. The first few weeks of the ThinkFeelDo program will teach you concepts related to how your behavior and thoughts affect how you feel and how you can gain more control of your mood and your life by changing your behaviors and thoughts. Every few days, we’ll give you a new lesson and in between each lesson will ask you to do some things to practice skills associated with that lesson. The Activity Tracker and Thought Tracker will help you do that. Right now only the Activity Tracker is available but the Thought Tracker will become available in a few days. You can look over the guides to teach you how to use the Activity Tracker and Thought Tracker and we’ll give you more ideas about how to use them in the first few lessons.

""My Coach""
An important part of your ThinkFeelDo experience is your coach.  Your coach will set up weekly phone calls to check in on your progress with ThinkFeelDo. If you have a question throughout the week regarding how to use ThinkFeelDo to manage your mood, you can send a message to your coach through the ThinkFeelDo website using the ""My Coach"" Feature located on the right-hand side of the screen. "
"Lesson #0: Think, Feel, Do Your Way Out of Depression",10,Wrapping Up,"Summary: ThinkFeelDo is a program designed to help you overcome your depression. We’ve designed lessons, tools, and guides that teach you skills and provided a coach to help support you during this program. Experiencing depression is difficult, but you can get better and ThinkFeelDo is here to help!

Moving Forward: Your first lesson starts tomorrow! Learn more about the link between behaviors and your mood by reading Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities. This lesson will teach you more about how the Activity Tracker can be helpful to notice patterns in your activities and mood. You can find Lesson #1 by first clicking on the ""Learn"" button on the left-hand side of the screen and then clicking on the lessons button. "
Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities,1,,"What you do affects how you feel. By learning more about the things that make you feel better or worse, you can begin to shape your life and take control of your depression.

In this lesson you'll learn:
-   How your behavior affects your mood
-   How to use a new tool--the Activity Tracker"
Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities,2,How your behavior affects your mood,"You are what you do
ThinkFeelDo adopts a “cognitive-behavioral” approach to treating depression.  This approach comes from Cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy treats depression by helping people change what they think and what they do. This approach is helpful because your behavior and your thoughts affect how you feel. Both are important, but today we are only going to look at the first part: How what you do (your behavior) affects how you feel.

Not all behaviors have the same effect on how you feel which means that the choices you make about what you do are important.

It's hard to feel good when you are not doing anything you feel good about. This idea makes a lot of sense to people after they have had a chance to think it over."
Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities,3,Keeping track of activities,"Because activities play an important role in our mood, tracking what you do and how you feel during activities can help you overcome depression. Tracking all these things might sound overwhelming, but it actually isn't so tough if you just take it one step at a time. We will start by helping you record your daily activities.  Obviously, we are not going to ask you to track everything you do on a given day, only the important activities that take up larger amounts of time. We’ll introduce a two-step process to help you get a clear idea of what you are doing that is helpful or unhelpful for your mood.  This is important information in helping you feel your best and manage times when life gets stressful."
Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities,4,But shouldn’t I wait until I have more energy?,"This still might seem like a lot of work and you might think it’s better to wait until you feel better and have more energy before you get started.  We understand this and hear this a lot. When people are feeling stressed, it's often hard to think about doing anything more. Sometimes, when your motivation is low and you've already got more than you can manage, it seems like waiting until you feel less stressed or have more time to start working on something is the best plan.

We’ve found, however, that it is actually best to just get moving and do positive activities even if you don’t feel like it. You have probably found based on your own experience that waiting until you feel better rarely works. This leads us to one of the basic ideas we will teach you in the ThinkFeelDo program: Action must come before Motivation.

If you wait until you feel like doing something, nothing will happen.  It's only by doing something that you're going to start getting motivated again.  

So don't wait until you ""feel better"" to start the tasks in this program, just get moving! You may be surprised at how helpful this will be to you.

"
Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities,5,"Using the Activity Tracker Tool
","We will be asking you to keep track of what you do and the time you spend doing it, in order to show how certain kinds of action can lead to motivation, rather than just the other way around.  To do this, you'll be using the Activity Tracker tool. You can find the Activity Tracker tool by clicking the ""Do"" button on the left-hand side of the screen. 
 
When using the Activity Tracker, the sooner you record your activities after you do them, the more accurate you will be.  In an ideal world, people would log their activity whenever they change what they are doing.  But we know that it is not possible to record every change in your activities as they happen.  Just try to keep as close of track as you can.
 
We recommend that you use the Activity Tracker more than once a day so that you can remember and enter activities sooner after you complete them. However, at a minimum, it is important to set aside some time at the end of each day to record your activities and to fill in all the gaps.  This is particularly important the first week or so you’re using the Activity Tracker."
Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities,6,Finding Patterns with the Activity Tracker,"Noticing patterns can help you change them
You can use the Activity Tracker tool to track what you do. Paying more attention to what you are (and are not doing) is an important (and necessary) step in figuring out which activities make you feel down or distressed, and which activities have the potential to lift your mood. You might notice big chunks of time when you are not doing much of anything or other patterns that add more stress to your life.
 
Everything you record on the Activity Tracker tool will be available for you and your coach to see. We’ve even made some filters and other ways of looking at your behavior that will help you learn more. As you keep using ThinkFeelDo, we’ll ask some more questions. These questions will help link your activities and your mood to give you more information to improve your life.  The Mood chart will show you how what you're doing is affecting your mood.  Often when you see your activities and mood all together, you will notice important patterns that you were not aware of!"
Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities,7,Keeping up with your Activity Tracker,"We will direct you to the Activity Tracker tool after you finish this lesson. To learn to use the Activity Tracker you should go back over your day yesterday and try to add everything you did into the Activity Tracker. This should take approximately 10 minutes to complete the first time you use it. You might have a hard time remembering what you did yesterday. That’s okay, just do your best. It’s easier, however, to add activities to the Activity Tracker as close to when they happened as possible. Over the next three days, keep track of your activities by entering the data into the Activity Tracker.  It may take a little longer the first time you use the Activity Tracker tool because there are guides to read to teach you how to use and get the most out of the Activity Tracker.  
 
Tracking your activities for these three days will be important for continuing on to the next lesson, where we'll begin using the information to change your patterns of behavior. The focus will shift from understanding your behavioral patterns to changing them."
Lesson #1: Monitoring Activities,8,Wrapping Up,"Summary: What you do impacts how you feel. Overcoming depression involves learning more about the things that help or hurt your mood and to increase the number of positive things you do. We taught you how the Activity Tracker can help you learn about these patterns.

Moving Forward: Please start using the Activity Tracker. Each day, try to make as complete a picture of your day as possible, focusing on the important activities. We recommend you complete at least 3 days of activity diaries. This will make it possible for you to identify specific behaviors that you can either change or continue in order to feel better.

We will be teaching you about other tools and concepts in the weeks ahead and they will build on the tools from previous lessons.  Give each of the tools a try.  The best way to learn new ideas is to practice!

Go ahead and click ""Do"" on the left-hand side of the screen to get started with the Activity Tracker. "
Summary #1:Monitoring Activities,1,,"Choosing activities that give you pleasure and a sense of accomplishment is extremely important in maintaining a positive mood.

Pleasurable activities are activities that lead to positive feelings like happiness or contentment. They are easy to identify because you just feel good after doing them.

Activities that provide a sense of accomplishment can help you feel satisfaction and a sense of control over your life. These are things that make you feel able to move ahead and accomplish the things you want to do and need to do. 

We will be asking you to use the Activity Tracker tool to keep track of what you do, the time you spend doing it, the amount of pleasure you get from it, and your sense of accomplishment. This will help to show how certain kinds of actions can lead to motivation and is an important step in figuring out which activities make you feel down or distressed and which activities have the potential to lift your mood.

When using the Activity Tracker, the sooner you record your activities after you do them, the more accurate you will be. We recommend that you use the Activity Tracker more than once a day so that you can remember and enter activities sooner after you complete them. Often when you see your activities all together, you will notice important patterns that you were not aware of! You will be asked to keep track of your activities every day for the next three days and enter the data into the Activity Tracker. "
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,1,,"Doing more positive activities can improve your mood. One way to do more positive activities is to plan and commit to doing an activity.

In this lesson you will:
-    Review the ideas behind increasing positive activities from the last lesson
-    Learn about making plans to make sure you do more positive activities
-    Learn how the Activity Tracker can help by committing to positive activities"
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,2,Review: Activities and your mood,"The importance of positive activities:
- For better or worse, our behaviors impact our mood.
- Positive activities make us feel better.
- One way to manage your mood is to increase the number of positive activities that you are doing.

Feeling sad, hopeless, or unmotivated can come from:
-Not doing enough positive activities
-Participating in too many activities that leave you feeling stressed and unhappy
-Avoiding activities that you don't want to do but would be helpful to do in the long run

As we move ahead and talk about positive activities, remember that this includes a range of things—spending time with family or friends, going out to dinner or a movie, getting a big task done, or even finishing up some small part of a chore instead of putting it off.  
 
The key is finding a balance between getting things done and enjoying yourself, rather than doing things that leave you feeling depressed (or avoiding things that would make you feel better). In this lesson, we'll be looking at how to plan ahead to schedule more positive activities into your life.

"
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,3,The Downward Spirals,"As we have discussed, a lack of activities can leave you feeling uninterested in life.  This can lead to two problem patterns.
 
1. The Motivation Spiral
When you're feeling stressed or down, your energy level goes down too.  When your energy is down, you are less motivated to do things that are positive; without those things, you feel more and more down.  Imagine if a friend invites you for dinner, but you're tired and feeling stressed out, so you stay home.  At home, there's nothing that helps you feel better, so your mood remains down, which means you're more likely to skip the next invitations too.

2. The Avoidance Spiral
When you’re feeling stressed or down, it might feel hard to get things done. When it feels hard to get things down, you might avoid things you need to do, when you avoid things you need to do the task gets bigger and harder to get started on. For example, you know you need to get the laundry done, but even looking at the huge pile of laundry leaves you feeling overwhelmed, so you turn on the TV and channel surf instead.  Sometimes, this happens when you attempt to deal with negative emotions in the shorter term, but the choices you make leave you feeling worse in the long-term. While in the moment, television may feel better than sorting laundry, as the laundry pile grows, so do the negative emotions.

Positive activities need to be increased, and negative responses decreased, in order to break out of the spirals.  We're going to start with increasing positive activities, which should help improve your motivation and energy level.

"
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,4,Planning Positive Activities,"Just like not doing positive activities can lead to negative spirals, doing positive activities can lead to upward spirals! Because of this, increasing the number of positive activities you do makes sense, let’s figure out how to do it!
 
One way to increase your positive activities is to schedule them. Making a formal commitment to an activity, like putting it into your calendar, increases the likelihood that you’ll follow through. Planning ahead also makes it easier to get something done. We'll go through four good ways to get started with scheduling positive activities"
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,5,,"1. Over the past few days, you’ve been keeping very close track of your activities using the Activity Tracker. If you go back and look at the activities you recorded you may be able to spot some activities that improve your mood.  Use the Filters in the Activity Tracker to help pick them out. These are activities we already know make you feel good. Try putting some of those into your Activity Tracker for the upcoming week.

2. It's common that when a person is feeling depressed, they stop doing activities they used to enjoy or don't get as much pleasure out of them as before. Think back to things you used to enjoy, even if you haven't done them in a while. It might even be useful to make a list of activities. Those can be great things to put on your Activity Tracker."
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,6,,"3. Plan ahead. Make the activity do-able, simple, and low stress. Take small steps to shape your environment to help you succeed. If you’re planning on going for a run, take out your running shoes and set them by the door. If you’re going to cook dinner, make sure you’ve gone shopping. If you’re going to tackle the laundry, make sure you have detergent.

4. Start small. Remember, you don’t have to do everything at once. If you haven’t done the laundry in awhile it might be helpful just to start with one load. If you need to clean your house, pick a room (or a corner) to get started. If you haven’t worked out in a long time, start with a short workout to get your body used to moving again. Remember even a small step is better than nothing, something beats nothing 100% of the time!"
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,7,,"What if positive activities I plan don't turn out to be enjoyable or give me a sense of accomplishment?
 
Remember, right now it is important to start getting active. It is true that some people don't enjoy things as much as they used to once they start getting active again—this is something that can improve as you go along. On the other hand, you may find you get more enjoyment or satisfaction than you expect! Isn't it worth a try? Again, something beats nothing 100% of the time!
"
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,8,"Keeping up with your Activity Tracker
","Try the Activity Tracker tool after you finish this lesson. This time when you use the Activity Tracker you should schedule activities you plan to do rather than activities you’ve already done. The first time you use it, plan one new positive activity a day for the next three days. This should take just a few minutes to complete the first time you use it. If you need help learning how to schedule activities on the Activity Tracker Tool, there are guides to read to teach you how to use and get the most out of the Activity Tracker.  "
Lesson #2: Scheduling Activities,9,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Doing more positive activities can make you feel better. Scheduling and committing to an activity increases the likelihood that you’ll do it. Overcoming depression involves doing more of the things that help your mood. We taught you how the Activity Tracker can help you plan activities that will help you learn more about the link between your actions and your mood.

Moving forward: We recommend using the Activity Tracker to plan activities. Start out by trying to schedule one new positive activity each day. After you do the activity, go back to your Activity Tracker to rate the activity. You can continue to track other activities with your Activity Tracker but to overcome depression you need to both learn about your current activities and change what you’re doing. Getting better is about doing new things.

Go ahead and click ""Do"" on the left-hand side of the screen to use your Activity Tracker to schedule an activity. "
Summary #2: Scheduling Activities,1,,"Negative emotions are complicated. Feeling sad, hopeless, or unmotivated can come from:
   -Not doing enough pleasurable activities
   -Not doing activities that provide a sense of accomplishment
   -Participating in too many activities that leave you feeling stressed and unhappy
   -Avoiding activities that you don't want to do

This can lead to two problem patterns:

The Motivation Spiral - When you're feeling stressed or down, your energy level goes down too.  When your energy is down, you are less motivated to do things that are positive; without those things, you feel more and more down. 

The Avoidance Spiral - This occurs when your attempts to deal with negative emtoions help in the short term, but eventually, just leave you feeling worse, which may cause you to continue to respond poorly to the situation. 

In order to break out of the spirals, positive activities need to be increased and negative responses decreased. One way to increase your positive activities is to schedule them. In the past week, you’ve been keeping very close track of your activities. Try putting some of the positive activities you’ve been tracking into your Activity Tracker for the upcoming week. It's common that when a person is feeling depressed, they stop doing activities they used to enjoy or don't get as much pleasure out of them as before. Think back to things you used to enjoy, even if you haven't done them in a while. Those can be great things to put on your Activity Tracker. It is true that some people don't enjoy things as much as they used to once they start getting active again—this is something that can improve as you go along."
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,1,,"The thoughts you have affect how you feel and behave. Many of our thoughts are “automatic,” which means that we don’t try to think them, they just come to us. Negative automatic thoughts are unhelpful because they are often unrealistic, unbalanced interpretations of situations that make us feel bad or prevent us from doing what we need to do. Noticing our thoughts can help us learn to change them and gain more control over our mood.

In this lesson you’ll learn:

-  Your thoughts, both positive and negative, affect how you feel and behave
-  To examine how you think and feel as a result of unpleasant situations
-  How using the Thought Tracker Tool to help you become more aware of how you behave over time

"
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,2,,"Your thoughts, both positive and negative, affect how you feel and behave

So far, we’ve talked about how what we do and how we feel are related. But, in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, another important idea is what we think and how we feel are related. In this lesson, we'll start to talk more about this and learn how noticing what goes through your mind can help improve your mood.  "
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,3,We Are What We Think,"You probably don't spend much time thinking about how blood flows through your body. If you pay attention to your heart rate, you can probably affect it a little, by changing your breathing or by exercising. But, if you stopped paying attention to it, your heart would still keep on beating.

Just like your heart pumps blood, the function of your brain, in part, is to produce thoughts. Some of these we are consciously aware of; others are produced more automatically. These “automatic thoughts” are going on all the time, even if we're not really paying attention to them.

Some automatic thoughts may be pleasant or positive. Others can be neutral. And still others are negative or unhelpful (e.g., ""I can't do anything right.""). We all have negative thoughts from time to time, but they become a problem if they happen too often or if we give too much power to them. Negative automatic thoughts make us feel sad, unmotivated, anxious, irritiable, ashamed - any number of negative feelings. And regardless of whether or not we are aware of our automatic thoughts, they do have an impact on how we interpret the world and how we feel."
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,4,Unhelpful Thoughts,"We will call these negative automatic thoughts ""unhelpful"" because they really don't help us manage our problems, find reasonable solutions, or be part of satisfying activities.

Often, unhelpful thoughts are inaccurate perceptions of the situation. We tend to accept automatic thoughts, including these unhelpful and inaccurate thoughts, as true, even when they are not. Accepting these negative automatic thoughts as true, without any kind of evaluation, can lead to negative emotions. Thoughts are not facts."
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,5,An Example of an Automatic Thought,"The following story shows how automatic thoughts can affect your mood:

Imagine that you are in a crowded elevator. Suddenly, you feel something poke you from behind. Then you feel somebody's finger touch your back a second time.

What might go through your mind in this situation? What thoughts do you think you would have?

What do you think you might feel? Irritated? Angry? Frightened?

Imagine that you turn around and see that the person who poked you is wearing dark sunglasses and carrying a white cane. You think to yourself, ""Oh they didn’t mean anything of it, this person is blind.""  

What might you feel then?  Sympathy? Concern?

Notice how new information, a different perspective, and most important, different thoughts, can change how you feel about a situation."
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,6,Points to Keep in Mind,"We will focus on the unhelpful thoughts (as opposed to other kinds of automatic thoughts) because those are the ones that cause problems.

Often these automatic thoughts go by very quickly, and it can be hard to recognize them. The first step will be learning to be aware of them.

Once you are able to recognize these negative thoughts, you will learn techniques to change them. We are not suggesting you should just ""think positive.""  Rather, the goal is to ""think realistic and balanced."" You will learn to do this first by becoming more aware of your unhelpful thoughts, and then learning how to evaluate and change them, so that they can become more realistic and balanced."
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,7,Identifying Automatic Thoughts,"Try to remember the last time something happened that caused you to feel a fairly strong emotion—positive or negative. If possible, find something that happened today or yesterday so the experience is fresh in your mind.

Consider the following questions about the situation:
-What happened?
-Who were you with?
-Where were you?
-What were you doing?"
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,8,Identifying Automatic Thoughts,"Consider the feelings you experienced in that situation.

Choose a feeling from below that describes how you were feeling:
-Sad
-Depressed
-Anxious
-Nervous
-Angry
-Overwhelmed
-Hopeless
-Jealous

Even though it's typical to have several or many emotions in response to a situation, we'll start with just one feeling, to simplify the exercise.

Notice that when we talk about an emotion, it's almost always going to be a one-word label. When labeling an emotion, there's no ""why"" (e.g., no ""angry because he did...""), just the emotion. The ""because"" or explanation component is part of the thought, which comes next."
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,9,Identifying Automatic Thoughts,"Identifying the thought can sometimes be difficult. A thought is a sentence you tell yourself or an image that passes through your mind. By a thought, we mean the exact words that went through your head at that moment. To help, here's a list of questions you can ask yourself to figure out what you were thinking at the time. You don't need to answer every question—just focus on the ones that seem to get at why your emotional response in this situation was as strong as it was:

What was going through my mind right then?
What does this situation say or mean about me? My life? My future?
What was I afraid might happen?
What did my role in this situation mean about how other people feel or think about me?
What does this event mean about other people in general?
What images or memories do I have about this situation?"
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,10,Using the Thought Tracker Tool,"We will direct you to the Thought Tracker tool after you finish this lesson. To learn to use the Thought Tracker, go back over your day yesterday and identify a situation when you felt bad. You can use the Thought Tracker to record what went through your mind in that situation. This should take approximately 10 minutes to complete the first time you use it. You might have a hard time remembering exactly what went through your mind during an upsetting situation yesterday. That’s okay, just do your best. It’s easier, however, to use the Thought Tracker as soon after a situation as possible, so you can remember the exact words that went through your mind. Over the next three days, keep track of your thoughts by entering them into the Thought Tracker.  It may take a little longer the first time you use the Thought Tracker tool because there are guides to read to teach you how to use and get the most out of the Thought Tracker.  

The more frequently you do use the Thought Tracker, the better you will become at identifying your thinking patterns.

And as you get better at understanding your thoughts, it will become easier to control the way you think.

Changing how you think, in turn, will help you to feel better and experience more satisfaction with your life.

Just like with the Activity Tracker, what you enter on your Thought Tracker will be shared with your coach. This may seem more personal than sharing your activities, but sharing your thoughts with others is a great way to get different perspectives on a situation. Enlisting other people may help you be able to come up with better ways to handle a challenge.  "
Lesson #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,11,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Automatic thoughts set us up for feeling certain ways. When automatic thoughts are negative and unhelpful, it's very easy to get tricked into feeling bad or giving up. By identifying and understanding our unhelpful automatic thoughts, we can begin to identify when our perceptions are inaccurate, and work to correct these. By controlling the ways we think, we can positively influence our emotions.

Moving forward: We recommend you start using the Thought Tracker to examine thoughts and feelings in specific situations. Start out by using the Thought Tracker to examine the thoughts you had in a situation earlier today or yesterday.  To continue forward, make sure to track 1 or 2 thoughts per day over the next 3 days. You can continue to schedule and track activities with your Activity Tracker, and increasing the number of positive activities you do is still important, but to overcome depression, it’s also important to learn how thoughts impact your mood and how changing your thinking can even help you do more positive things!  Using the Thought Tool will prepare you for future lessons, where we'll talk more about thoughts and their role in our mood and behavior.

You now have learned the most important basic concepts in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. That our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are related and that we can learn more about ourselves and gain control of our mood and our lives by noticing and changing our thoughts and behaviors. This is why we call this site: ThinkFeelDo. The Activity Tracker and Thought Tracker are designed to help put these concepts into action, so use them as much as possible. We’ll continue to teach you more about Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy in future lessons.  

Go ahead and click ""Think"" on the left-hand side of the screen to get started with the Thought Tracker. "
Summary #3: Unhelpful Thoughts,1,,"Your thoughts affect how you feel and behave. You can help manage how you feel by monitoring how you think about things in your life.

Automatic Thoughts: Your brain produces thoughts that sometimes occur without you paying attention to them. You might not be aware of them, but they do affect how you feel and interpret the world.

Negative/Unhelpful Thoughts: Some automatic thoughts can be negative (e.g., “I can’t do anything right”). They make us feel bad and don’t help us manage our problems. They are often inaccurate perceptions of situations.

Monitoring Unhelpful Thoughts: When was the last time something happened that caused you to feel a strong emotion? What happened? Who were you with? 

Consider the feelings you experienced in that situation.

Now that you've described the situation and how it made you feel, identify the thought. Ask yourself: What did I conclude about the situation that led to my emotion? What was going through my mind right then? What does this situation say or mean about me? My life? My future? What was I afraid might happen?

This exercise is the basis for the Thought Tracker. Use it to become better at identifying your thinking patterns."
Lesson #4: Different Types of Positive Activities: Pleasure and Mastery,1,,"Activities can benefit us in different ways. Some activities make us feel happy, joyful, content, or relaxed others help us reach our goals and make us feel accomplished and capable. Both of these types of activities are important for promoting a healthy mood and life.

In this lesson you'll learn:
-    Activities can be positive in different ways.
-    What makes an activity “positive” including “pleasure” and “accomplishment”
-    Why increasing pleasurable activities and meaningful activities are both important."
Lesson #4: Different Types of Positive Activities: Pleasure and Mastery,2,"Different Types of Positive Activities
","Not all activities are created equal. Just like some activities improve your mood and other activities hurt your mood, activities can be positive in different ways. These activities might be useful at different times. Sometimes it is important to relax to allow the body and mind a chance to recover. Other times it may be important to do something really fun, to laugh and try to enjoy life again after a tough couple weeks of experiencing a really low mood. And still other times, it is important to get things done to help keep up with your chores and accomplish your goals. All of these things can help your mood. Some may do so more in the short-term and others might be more beneficial in the long-term. Let’s start by learning about what makes pleasure and a sense of accomplishment helpful."
Lesson #4: Different Types of Positive Activities: Pleasure and Mastery,3,"How activities that give you pleasure and a sense of accomplishment are beneficial:
","How activities that give you pleasure and a sense of accomplishment are beneficial:

Two kinds of positive
Although ""pleasure"" and ""a sense of accomplishment"" sound similar, they are not exactly the same.
-    Pleasure refers to the positive feelings, like happiness or contentment, you feel while doing an activity. These activities are easy to identify because you just feel good after doing them.
-    Sense of accomplishment refers to the satisfaction and a sense of control over your life you experience while doing an activity. These are things that make you feel able to move ahead and accomplish the things you want to do and need to do.  

Positive activities might be high in pleasure, high in accomplishment, or both. When you rate or schedule an activity, you can rate how much pleasure and sense of accomplishment you experienced or think you will experience.  "
Lesson #4: Different Types of Positive Activities: Pleasure and Mastery,4,Using the Activity Tracker to Increase Pleasure and Accomplishment,"Every positive thing you do is one step closer to a healthy mood
Clearly, experiencing pleasure and a sense of accomplishment from the things you do is extremely important in maintaining a positive mood.  You can use the Activity Tracker tool to track the amount of pleasure and sense of accomplishment you are experiencing over various time periods. This is an important (and necessary) step in figuring out which activities make you feel down or distressed, and which activities have the potential to lift your mood.

The most important goal, however, is to increase the amount of pleasure and accomplishment you experience. Based on what you are currently doing that might mean planning more pleasurable activities, more activities that provide a sense of accomplishment, or both. Tracking the amount of pleasure and accomplishment you are experiencing in different activities can give you an idea of what activities to schedule in the future. Also, predicting how much pleasure and accomplishment you will experience in different activities gives you a good idea if you’re on the right track."
Lesson #4: Different Types of Positive Activities: Pleasure and Mastery,5,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Positive activities can either be pleasurable, provide a sense of accomplishment, or both. All of these activities can improve your mood and having a balance of activities from these different categories is important to create a healthy and happy life.

Moving forward: Before you move on to the next lesson, you need to use the Activity Tracker to increase the amount of pleasure and accomplishment in your life. Start out by trying to schedule pleasurable activity or activity that will provide a sense of accomplishment each day. We’ll ask you to rate pleasure and accomplishment on a 1-10 scale so you might start by finding activities that are a 6 or greater. Over time, you might look for activities that provide more pleasure and accomplishment, but it’s good to start small and build on your success. After you do the activity, go back to your Activity Tracker to rate how much pleasure and accomplishment you experienced. You can continue to note thoughts on the Thought Tracker as changing both what you do and what you think is helpful for overcoming depression.  "
Summary #4: Different types of positive activities,1,,"Not all activities are created equal. There are two important types of positive activities: those which bring you pleasure and those which give you a sense of accomplishment.  Pleasure refers to activities which bring emotions like contentment or happiness.  Accomplishment activities generate a sense of satisfaction and control over your life.  By increasing both types of activities in your life, and ideally replacing activities that generate problem emotions, you can take control of your mood.  The Activity Tracker is here to help you with that task!"
Lesson #5: Roadblocks to Doing Positive Activities,1,,"Doing positive activities will make us feel better but when we are depressed we often don’t feel like doing anything. When we’re feeling depressed, we also tend to have more unhelpful thoughts that get in the way of doing positive activities. Fortunately, identifying these roadblocks and thoughts, can help us overcome them. 

In this lesson you'll learn:
-    How to identify the obstacles that keep you from doing positive activities
-    How thoughts can be obstacles to positive activities
-    Why identifying thoughts can help you do more positive activities"
Lesson #5: Roadblocks to Doing Positive Activities,2,What keeps you from doing positive activities?,"Of course it sounds nice to do more positive activities, but following through on this often feels much more difficult. Sometimes, it’s important to look at what’s keeping you from doing positive activities. You can start by trying to finish these sentences:

“I would have done it BUT….”

Or

“I can’t do it because…”

Common roadblocks people experience are not enough time or energy. If one of these roadblocks come up, ask yourself if there is a smaller step you can start with that would be better than doing nothing."
Lesson #5: Roadblocks to Doing Positive Activities,3,"Thoughts as Roadblocks to Positive Activities
","Another common roadblock is your thoughts
People experience more unhelpful thoughts when depressed. Some of these thoughts get in the way of you doing positive activities because they undermine your motivation, your confidence, your motivation, or all kinds of other things.

These might be thoughts like “No one wants to hang out with me” or “It’s not worth it to do the laundry if I’m not able to finish it.”

Thoughts like this are unhelpful because they stop you in your tracks before you even get started. But if you’re able to notice these thoughts, and realize that they’re unhelpful thoughts and not facts, then you’re more likely to be able to do a positive activity and experience the pleasure and accomplishment that comes from it!"
Lesson #5: Roadblocks to Doing Positive Activities,4,Tracking Unhelpful Thoughts that are Roadblocks,"If you are scheduling an activity in your Activity Tracker and you notice you have a doubt about being able to complete it, ask yourself if an unhelpful thought is getting in the way. If it is an unhelpful thought, put it down in your Thought Tracker. It’ll be useful to notice these unhelpful thoughts and we’ll teach you more about patterns in thinking and changing thoughts in future lessons. Also, remember that when you schedule an event you should rate the amount of pleasure and accomplishment you think you’ll experience in this event. Underestimating pleasure and accomplishment is one example of unhelpful thinking that happens when people experience depression. Some activities you might think won’t be very pleasurable or bring much accomplishment, but you won’t know unless you try."
Lesson #5: Roadblocks to Doing Positive Activities,5,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Depression and unhelpful thoughts can get in the way of doing positive activities. Fortunately, by identifying unhelpful thoughts that prevent you from doing activities you can learn how to then change these thoughts to help increase the number of positive activities that you do.  

Moving forward: As you move on to the next lesson we’ll continue to talk about the role that thoughts play in your mood and your life. During the next few days, keep scheduling one new positive activity each day, pay particularly close attention to any unhelpful thoughts that might arise when you are scheduling these events. If you notice an unhelpful thought, put it into your Thought Tracker."
Summary #5: Roadblocks to doing positive activities,1,,"Positive activities can improve our mood, but that doesn’t mean its easy to get started on them.  Common roadblocks include not enough time or energy.  Try breaking those activities into smaller parts so they won’t be as overwhelming to start.  Additionally, when people are down, their thoughts can take a turn for the negative.  Some of these thoughts get in the way of your doing positive activities because they undermine your motivation, your confidence, your motivation, or all kinds of other things. Identify those thoughts and try to challenge them!"
Lesson #6: Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,1,,"What we think affects how we feel. To better understand this relationship, it’s helpful to think about specific categories or patterns of negative automatic thoughts. These patterns represent common thinking traps we fall into that lead to inaccurate, unbalanced, and unhelpful thoughts.

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
-   The types of dysfunctional thinking patterns that occur and how to recognize them in yourself.
-    Skills that are specific to changing each type of dysfunctional thought pattern."
Lesson #6: Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,2,,"The ""Cognitive-Behavioral"" approach to managing stress and mood involves understanding and changing your thinking patterns that contribute to how you feel. We will focus on helping you develop specific thinking skills to identify and challenge these negative thinking patterns so your mood is under your control.

Twelve kinds of Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts
As you begin identifying your Unhelpful Thoughts, you may notice that:
-    You have specific patterns of thinking
-    Certain patterns of thinking arise in specific types of situations
-    You have a particular manner or style of interpreting stressful situations

When we feel upset, we see everything in a somewhat distorted way. This falsely represents the way things actually are. There may be elements of truth to our thinking, but these inaccurate thoughts may set off patterns of thinking that are often distorted too. The next page will let you explore the different kinds of Thought Distortions that may be contributing to your unhelpful thoughts..."
Lesson #6: Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,3,Thought Distortions,"All-or-Nothing (Black-or-White) Thinking
You think in black and white terms; there are no gray areas. This type of thinking is unrealistic because things are seldom all or nothing, good or bad.

Overgeneralization
You assume that a one-time or situation-specific negative occurrence will happen again and again, or in every context. Often words like “all,” “always” or “never” are signs that you may be overgeneralizing.

Mental Filter
You focus exclusively on negative details and ignore anything positive. Because you are filtering out the positives, you see the entire situation as negative.

Discounting the Positive
You turn positives into negatives by insisting they “don’t count.” This allows you to maintain your negative outlook despite positive experiences."
Lesson #6: Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,4,Thought Distortions,"Fortune Telling
You act as a fortune teller who only predicts the worst for you. You then treat your unrealistic prediction as if it were a proven fact.

Magnification or Catastrophizing
You magnify negative things, blowing their importance out of proportion. You convince yourself that the future looks hopeless and bad outcomes are sure to happen.

Minimization
You minimize positive things, shrinking down their significance. You make good experiences out to be smaller than they are.

Emotional Reasoning
You take your emotions as proof of the way things really are. You assume something is true because you feel it is, rather than by examining the evidence."
Lesson #6: Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,5,Thought Distortions,"“Should” Statements
You build your expectations with “shoulds,” “musts,” and “oughts.” When you don’t follow through, you feel guilty. When others disappoint you, you feel angry and resentful.

Labeling and mislabeling
You label yourself or someone else, rather than just identifying the behavior, or you mislabel an event by using inaccurate and emotionally extreme language.

Personalization
You take responsibility for thing that you don’t have control over."
Lesson #6: Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,6,How can identifying Thought Patterns be useful?,"When people are stressed, they often settle into a ""groove"" of thinking in certain unhelpful ways--these Thought Distortions are those grooves that people fall into.  Identifying and understanding the patterns you fall into helps you get out of that groove. Figuring out which Thought Distortions you frequently use can also be very beneficial when coming up with alternatives to the kinds of Unhelpful Thoughts you may be experiencing.

"
Lesson #6: Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,7,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Negative thoughts can often be grouped into categories or patterns. Learning what thinking traps you typically fall into can help you avoid these traps in the future. By avoiding unrealistic, unbalanced, and unhelpful ways of thinking, you can gain more control over your mood, your actions, and your life.  

Moving forward: Before you move on to the next lesson, please start using the Thought Tracker to identify the Thoughts distortions for your unhelpful thoughts. Start out by using the Thought Tracker to identify the thought distortions for thoughts you have already added.  In the future, when you enter a new thought, you can add a Thought Distortion tag. These Thought Distortions are one more piece in the process of helping you to understand the relationship between what you're doing, how you're feeling, and what you're thinking.  Try to identify 3 thought distortions over the next few days. In the next lesson, we'll use these Thought Distortions to help you challenge your unhelpful thinking."
Summary #6: Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,1,,"As you begin identifying unhelpful thoughts, you may notice that you have specific patterns of thinking, that certain patterns arise in specific types of situations, and that you may have a particular style in which you interpret stressful situations.

Thought Distortions: Sometimes when we are upset, we tend to see situations in a somewhat distorted way that falsely represents reality. There may be elements of truth to our understanding, but when feelings and thoughts get extreme our thinking patterns often become distorted too.

When people are stressed, they often settle into a ""groove"" of thinking in certain unhelpful ways. Identifying and understanding the patterns you fall into when stressed helps get you out of that groove.  Figuring out which Thought Distortions you frequently use can also be very beneficial when coming up with alternatives to the kinds of negative unhelpful thoughts you may be experiencing."
Lesson #7: Alternative Thoughts,1,,"Thoughts are not facts. When we’re feeling depressed, many of our thoughts become more negative. These include more inaccurate, unrealistic, and unbalanced thoughts about our self, our world, and our future. Because these thoughts are not facts however, we can learn to think about ourselves, situations, the world, and the future, in more helpful ways.

In this lesson you’ll learn:

-    How changing your thinking can help improve your mood
-    How to evaluate your unhelpful thoughts and replace them with more helpful thoughts
-    How to use evidence to create alternative thoughts
-    A framework for examining and changing your thinking"
Lesson #7: Alternative Thoughts,2,,"Our view of the world is affected by how we feel.  Please keep in mind that when we are down or stressed, we see the world through different lenses. This means we interpret things that happen to us in negative ways - our thinking is distorted by our emotions.  For example, if a cashier in a store is not friendly and avoids looking at you, you might think ""I look unattractive,"" or ""I did something wrong,"" or ""she can tell I'm weird.""  You'd probably leave the store feeling pretty bad if you were having thoughts like that.

Changing Thoughts—Changing Emotions

ThinkFeelDo: Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors all affect each other.

In the previous lessons, we saw how changing behaviors can make us feel better. Similarly, changing our thoughts can make us feel better as well. When you start to pay more attention to your thoughts, you might notice that you have lots of negative automatic thoughts right before your mood changes. When you begin to recognize and change these unhelpful thoughts, you will start to feel better."
Lesson #7: Alternative Thoughts,3,What if my negative thoughts are accurate?,"There are times when our unhelpful thoughts have some basis in fact.  But even when something is based on evidence, we may be inaccurate in thinking about the implications or most likely outcomes. In this way, our emotional lenses can make us think in a way that is exaggerated or one-sided.  It's hard to think clearly when you're stressed and not feeling like your normal self.

"
Lesson #7: Alternative Thoughts,4,,"Let's look at our last example and take it a bit further.  For instance, so what if the store clerk doesn’t like you?

Does everyone in the world have to like you?

Does the opinion of a store clerk really mean anything about you?

Once you leave the store, how will that clerk ever affect your life again if you don’t think about it anymore?

It is possible that the unhelpful thought could have been partially accurate.  But so what?  Does it matter that much?  Is feeling bad about this helpful? 

There are ways to deal with these sorts of feelings and thoughts as well."
Lesson #7: Alternative Thoughts,5,,"Think about an unpleasant situation that you may have experienced that may have made you feel negative feelings and thoughts.

Step One:  Evaluate your thinking

After you have identified the thought you had in the unpleasant situation, the next step is to examine it more closely.  Look for evidence that either supports or does not support what you are thinking. For example, if you feel that you never do anything right, could you name some things that you have done successfully?

Step Two:  Challenge your unhelpful thoughts
You may discover that some of your thoughts don't make a lot of sense and that they are clearly unhelpful in how they make you feel. And, as you now know there are many other (and better) ways to try to understand situations. Consider alternate ways of thinking about what happened. Then fill in the explanation that you think is most likely to be accurate. Don't worry if you feel a little bit uncertain of this. You have been living with your unhelpful thoughts for a long time. There will be opportunities later in the program to practice and improve these skills. Right now, the most important thing is to start examining your unhelpful thoughts and begin to come up with positive alternative thoughts."
Lesson #7: Alternative Thoughts,6,,"Try asking yourself some of these questions and then spend a little time considering your answers. You can learn some useful things about your automatic thoughts and what you could replace them with this way.
-Is there an alternative explanation?
-Have I had any experiences that show this thought is not completely true all the time?
-How does this unhelpful thought not fit in with how I wish I could see myself?
-Is there an exception to the rule I have created in my distorted patterns?
-What value is there in holding on to this rule?
-Is it possible I'm blowing this out of proportion? What is a more reasonable way to look at this?
-Have I oversimplified the issue? What is a less emotional description of the problem?
-What is my role in this situation? Have I assigned all the blame to others?
-What is the effect of believing my automatic thought?
-What could be the effect of changing my automatic thought?
-If my best friend was in the situation and had this thought what would I tell him/her?"
Lesson #7: Alternative Thoughts,7,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Just because you have a negative thought doesn’t mean you have to listen to it.  Learning to challenge and change your thinking can help you have more control over what you feel and how you react.

Moving forward: Before you move on to the next lesson, use the Thought Tracker to generate alternative thoughts. Start out by using the Thought Tracker to come up with alternatives for thoughts distortions you have already added.  In the future, when you notice a negative automatic thought, try to come up with an alternative thought in the moment and add this thought and alternative to your Thought Tracker. This might be hard at first, but the more you practice the easier it will become and the better you will feel. Try to create 3 alternative thoughts over the next few days."
Summary #7: Alternative Thoughts,1,,"The next step is to learn to evaluate your unhelpful thoughts and replace them with alternative thoughts that are more positive or that have a more accurate and balanced perception of the situation.

Step One:  Evaluate your thinking
Look for evidence that either supports or does not support what you are thinking. Consider how this thought fits in with your perceptions of yourself or your future life.

Step Two:  Challenge your unhelpful thoughts
You may discover that some of your thoughts are clearly unhelpful and that there are many other (and better) ways to try to understand situations. Consider alternate ways of thinking about what happened. Then fill in the explanation that you think is most likely to be accurate."
Lesson #8: Disrupting Patterns of Unhelpful Thinking,1,,"Once you have identified unhelpful thoughts, it is easier to deal with them. You can take a really good look at them and decide whether they are properly realistic, accurate, and balanced or overly harmful. Identifying the pattern of unhelpful thoughts can be particularly useful as your strategy for coming up with an alternative thought might differ based on the specific pattern of thinking that thought relates to.

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
-    Helpful responses to common patterns of unhelpful thinking
-    Tips to continue to replace unhelpful thoughts with more helpful thoughts"
Lesson #8: Disrupting Patterns of Unhelpful Thinking,2,,"We’ve already talked about how changing your thoughts and thinking patterns can help you manage stress and your mood. In this lesson, we’ll return to the different patterns of negative thinking and talk about specific questions that can be useful to create more helpful thoughts when you encounter each pattern.

Remember the twelve kinds of patterns of unhelpful thoughts? Certain patterns of thinking may arise in specific types of situations or you may have a particular manner or style of interpreting stressful situations. Identifying these patterns can be useful as it helps you to get out of that groove of unhelpful thinking and into a groove of thinking more realistically to help manage your mood and your life."
Lesson #8: Disrupting Patterns of Unhelpful Thinking,3,Questions to help you challenge negative thinking,"After you identify a pattern, the next step is to challenge the negative thinking that contributes to your depression. Then we'll practice using them with the Thought Record Tool.  Let's look at specific questions to ask yourself when you're experiencing a certain Thought Distortion...

All-or-Nothing (Black-or-White) Thinking
You think in black and white terms; there are no gray areas. This type of thinking is unrealistic because things are seldom all or nothing, good or bad.
Questions:
-    Are there “shades of grey” that you are overlooking?
-    Are there exceptions to your all or nothing thinking? Look for them.
-    What if you looked at the issue along a continuum rather than in simple categories?

Overgeneralization
You assume that a one-time or situation-specific negative occurrence will happen again and again, or in every context. Often words like “all,” “always” or “never” are signs that you may be overgeneralizing.
Questions:
-    Are you condemning yourself based on a single event?
-    What if you focused on describing rather than judging? Rather than overgeneralizing- “I’ll never amount to anything” try describing instead- “I feel nervous about this project I'm doing at work”
-    What would you think if you kept track of positive occurrences that don’t fit with your overgeneralization?

Mental Filter
You focus exclusively on negative details and ignore anything positive. Because you are filtering out the positives, you see the entire situation as negative.
Questions:
-    How would you feel if you acknowledged the positive information?
-    How might other people see this issue? Would they pick up on positive things that had happened?
-    What would be the consequence if everyone didn’t notice positive events and only saw things as negative?

Discounting the Positive
You turn positives into negatives by insisting they “don’t count.” This allows you to maintain your negative outlook despite positive experiences.
Questions:
-    Are you focusing on the negative side of things exclusively?
-    Would you discount the positive characteristics of someone you cared about? If not, then how come you would not count them for yourself?
-    Are you overlooking your strengths and accomplishments?

Mind Reading
You assume that you know what someone else is thinking. You are so convinced that the person is having a negative reaction to you, you don’t even take the time to confirm your guess.
Questions:
-    Can you really know for sure what someone is thinking?
-    Is it possible the other person is not thinking exactly what you expect? Can you come up with alternative explanations for what they could be thinking?
-    How could you find out if your mind reading is true or not?

Fortune Telling
You act as a fortune teller who only predicts the worst for you. You then treat your unrealistic prediction as if it were a proven fact.
Questions:
-    What is the worst possible outcome? Could you cope with that?
-    What would it be like to find out how it really is rather than just imagine it?
-    Can you really predict the future? Is your prediction making it more likely that things will turn out that way?"
Lesson #8: Disrupting Patterns of Unhelpful Thinking,4,,"Magnification or Catastrophizing
You magnify negative things, blowing their importance out of proportion. You convince yourself that the future looks hopeless and bad outcomes are sure to happen.
Questions:
-    Is it possible the problem is not really “terrible” “awful” or “horrible”?
-    Are you telling yourself that you cannot possibly cope with this issue? If so, is it possible for you to identify or learn coping skills to deal with the challenge?
-    Even if one possible outcome is catastrophic, is such a bad end likely to actually be the result? If it didn't end up being quite as bad, would it be as distressing?

Minimization
You minimize positive things, shrinking down their significance. You make good experiences out to be smaller than they are.
Questions:
-    Is it possible the positive thing is true? What would happen if you accepted a positive statement?
-    What are the advantages/disadvantages of continuing to minimize positive things? What would happen if everyone minimized?
-    What if a friend minimized positive things that you said to him or her?

Emotional Reasoning
You take your emotions as proof of the way things really are. You assume something is true because you feel it is, rather than by examining the evidence.
Questions:
-    Is this a helpful basis for making conclusions about yourself, others, or your future?
-    Would the issue seem different to you if you were in a different mood? What does that tell you about how helpful it is to make conclusions based on how you feel?
-    Just because you feel something, that doesn’t make it a fact. What evidence do you have that supports or discounts this?

“Should” Statements
You build your expectations with “shoulds,” “musts,” and “oughts.” When you don’t follow through, you feel guilty. When others disappoint you, you feel angry and resentful.
Questions:
-    Are you setting realistic standards for yourself or others? Instead of focusing on regret about the difference between the way things are or were and the way you want them to be, how would it be to concentrate on getting the most out of the real situation?
-    Are you getting upset about the way you would like things to be (or have been), rather than as they are?
-    How would you feel if you told yourself “I would prefer…” rather than “I should…”

Labeling and mislabeling
You label yourself or someone else, rather than just identifying the behavior, or you mislabel an event by using inaccurate and emotionally extreme language.
Questions:
-    How would you feel if you described the issue rather than applying a rigid label to it?
-    Can you or others really be reduced to simple labels? Isn’t this oversimplifying things?
-    How would you feel if you identified a number of characteristics about yourself or others that do not fit with the label?

Personalization
You take responsibility for things that you don’t have control over.
Questions:
•    Are you taking personally something that has little or nothing to do with you? Is there another possible explanation?
•    Is it possible that someone else may be at least partially responsible for the issue, too?
•    Rather than personalizing blame, what would happen if instead you asked yourself “What problem needs to be solved here?” and took some action? Is it possible to take responsibility for a problem without playing the blame game?"
Lesson #8: Disrupting Patterns of Unhelpful Thinking,5,Wrapping Up,"Summary: When you notice a pattern of unhelpful thinking this is a perfect opportunity to practice the skill of coming up with an alternative thought. We know this can be tough, but fortunately, identifying the pattern can make this easier because specific questions might be more helpful for each pattern. Avoiding these thinking traps in the future can help you gain more control over your mood, your actions, and your life.  

Moving forward: Before you move on to the next lesson, please start using the Thought Tracker to identify the patterns of unhelpful thinking for thoughts and generate alternative thoughts. To continue forward, make sure to identify 3 thought distortions and generate an alternative thought for each over the next few days.
"
Summary #8: Disrupting Patterns of Unhelpful Thoughts,1,,"Identifying your thoughts is the important first step to changing them.  There are common patterns that emerge from unhelpful thoughts.  If you can label what pattern your thoughts fit, some specific questions you can ask yourself can help you develop new, more balanced ways of responding to the situation.  Check out the lesson “Disrupting Patterns of Unhelpful Thinking” for examples of the questions.  Practice using the Thought Tracker to develop new approaches to your problem."
Lesson #9: Avoidance,1,,"People often use behaviors to avoid and escape from difficult situations and feelings. Many times, they do not realize that they are avoiding something, or they do not know what they are trying to avoid. These behaviors relieve uncomfortable feelings in the short-term, but in the long-term they do not help. In fact, they often create more problems and painful emotions!

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
-    Common triggers for avoidance
-    How to identify your responses to triggers
-    How to recognize different kinds of avoidance patterns"
Lesson #9: Avoidance,2,Triggers,"Sometimes negative emotions seem to come ""out of the blue."" There are many different kinds of triggers for these emotions, and people are often unfamiliar with them. Here are some types of triggers that may be important for you.

Historical Triggers: Days or seasons of the year that remind you of losses in the past. These can be anniversaries of a divorce, the death or illness of a loved one, or other difficult memories.

External Triggers: These include situations such as times of day, certain tasks or activities, or social interactions where you notice that your mood is worse. You may have been able to use the Activity Tracker to notice some of these triggers.

Internal Triggers: Thoughts and physical sensations that upset you. For example, someone may notice their mood drop when they worry or experience physical pain."
Lesson #9: Avoidance,3,Responses to Triggers,"Responses are the emotions people feel when they face one of their triggers. Because certain emotions feel uncomfortable, people often let them guide their behavior. So in order to avoid unpleasant emotional responses, people often avoid their triggers.

People can still behave in adaptive ways, even when they are experiencing negative emotions. By recognizing triggers, people can stop letting temporary emotions dictate their behavior.
"
Lesson #9: Avoidance,4,Understanding Emotional Responses,"When people experience an unpleasant emotional response, it can be hard to figure out exactly which emotions are involved. Learning to identify different emotional states helps to understand why the trigger is upsetting you. The following 3 emotional states can happen on their own, or in combination. Let's start with some ways you can recognize anger.

Anger

Common Physical Signs of Anger:
•    Clenching your fists or jaw
•    Faster breathing or heart rate
•    Muscle tension

Common External Triggers of Anger:
•    Others do not do what you want

Lesson #9: Avoidance,6,Avoidance Patterns,"Now that you have learned more about triggers and emotional responses, you are ready to start thinking about your behaviors when you face triggers. Consider some times recently when you have felt angry, sad, or afraid. As you read about these common avoidance patterns, think about whether you are using some of these avoidance patterns to deal with those negative emotions.

Everyone uses avoidant behaviors sometimes--these behaviors become a problem when they are used too much, stop you from solving problems, or make you feel worse in the long-run."
Lesson #9: Avoidance,7,Examples of Avoidance Patterns,"Procrastination
Doing ""productive"" activities instead of higher-priority tasks (e.g., cleaning the apartment instead of preparing for tomorrow's work presentation)

Sleep and Inactivity
Giving up positive activities outside your home, allowing distraction to keep you from doing things you can and should do

Complaining

Getting temporary relief by ""venting"" to other people at the expense of more productive, enjoyable, or two-way conversation"
Lesson #9: Avoidance,8,Examples of Avoidance Patterns,"Rumination
""Re-playing"" a real or imaginary event over and over, over-analyzing situations that are out of your control, thinking about doing something you need to do (instead of doing it), ""beating yourself up"" over past mistakes

Doing things to ""space out"" or numb your emotions
Watching television or surfing websites, using drugs or alcohol, smoking, daydreaming, overeating

Withdrawing from interactions with other people
Avoiding social situations or new people, always staying silent when someone does something that upsets you, avoiding people you believe you have disappointed, avoiding confrontation by saying ""yes"" to things you don't want to do"
Lesson #9: Avoidance,9,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Awareness is the first step toward changing any behavior. After this lesson, try looking over your daily activity record for the past week. Do you notice any activities that could have been avoidance? During the next week, please use the Activity Tracker tool to keep a record when you notice any of the following elements:
 (T)rigger – A situation, time period, person, thought, or
physical sensation that triggers discomfort.
 (R)esponse - The specific emotions you feel when the
trigger happens. Anger, fear, and sadness are some of the
first emotions to consider. Identifying your emotions will help
you better understand why the trigger bothered you.
 (A)voidance (P)attern - Something you do to avoid the trigger and response. You can recognize these behaviors because they bring some short-term emotional relief, but they do not help you in the long run.

Keeping a record of your TRAPs will help to break them down into more manageable pieces."
Lesson #9: Avoidance,10,Wrapping Up,Moving Forward: Knowledge is power! Understanding your avoidance is the first step toward taking control of your behavior and keeping situations and temporary emotions from controlling you.  Try to make note in your Activity Tracker of any behaviors you think might be avoidance patterns.  These would be great to share with your group in order to get feedback.
Summary #9: Avoidance,1,,"People often use behaviors to avoid and escape from difficult situations and feelings. These behaviors relieve uncomfortable feelings in the short-term, but in the long-term they do not help.  Triggers of unpleasant emotions come in many different forms - historical triggers, external triggers and internal triggers.  Triggers can lead to avoidance patterns which include procrastination, sleep/inactivity, venting to others, rumination or replaying negatives over and over again in your head, “spacing out” by mindlessly watching tv or surfing the web, and withdrawing from people.  Although these behaviors may improve how you feel in the moment, its important to identify when you’re avoiding and find more appropriate responses that will give you a long-term boost to your mood."
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,1,,"“Seeing is believing” and sometimes the best way to evaluate one’s thoughts are to test them out. This helps gather evidence to evaluate thoughts when you don’t have other information. Action experiments are an important way to try new things.

In this lesson you’ll learn how to:
-    Combine ideas related to the Activity and Thought Trackers
-    Learn a new strategy for testing your alternative thoughts"
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,2,Believing Your New Alternative Thoughts,"Sometimes new ways of thinking don't result in new, more positive behaviors. This happens when you don’t believe a new alternative thought very strongly. You might come up with an alternative thought that makes sense intellectually, but you don’t believe it emotionally. One reason this can happen is that you simply don’t have enough experience (or data) to support your new alternative thought. For example, if you are feeling stressed and a friend invites you to a party, you might have the following automatic thought: ""If I go to the party I will have a terrible time"". You could challenge it with the following alternative thought: ""If I go to the party, I will enjoy myself and I will probably be glad that I went."" This thought might make logical sense, but you might not believe it very strongly, maybe because you haven't been to a party in a long time, or because you just aren't feeling motivated to go. So, there is no way to know whether or not this new thought is valid unless you go to the party and test it out!"
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,3,Testing Out Your Alternative Thoughts,"Automatic thoughts are like personal theories. Just like scientists need data to test their theories, people need data (new experiences) to test their automatic thoughts. The more data or supporting experiences you have for a thought, the more you will believe it. Often we believe negative automatic thoughts, even when they are inaccurate, because we have avoided doing things so often we don’t have any evidence to the contrary. This lesson will introduce a new strategy - the action experiment - that will help you gather additional data.  Even if you already believe your new alternative thought, an action experiment can still be beneficial. You can get even greater benefit from an alternative thought if you practice behaving in ways that are consistent with the new way of thinking. Action experiments will help you plan activities that are consistent with your new thoughts."
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,4,Action Experiment,"An Action Experiment is a specific plan that will test out a new thought or belief. You will schedule an activity that will generate more data or information about the alternative thought you created in the Thought Tracker. Just as the helpful questions were useful in figuring out and testing your automatic thoughts, an Action Experiment will test out your alternative thoughts. You are simply collecting more data to determine whether or not your new alternative thought is accurate. Most people are surprised to find that there is more evidence for their new, helpful thoughts than they initially expected!"
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,5,How to Create an Action Experiment,"Step 1) Plan an activity to test your Alternative Thought
Step 2) Re-evaluate your Alternative Thought after the activity
Step 3) Prepare for possible negative outcomes or success of the experiment"
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,6,Step 1) Plan an activity to test your Alternative Thought,"The first step in developing an action experiment is to plan an activity that will provide additional data about your alternative thought. You might want to ask yourself the following questions:
-    How can I find out if this alternative thought is accurate?
-    How can I put this alternative thought to the test to see if it is true?
-    How would I behave differently if I believed this alternative thought were 100% true?
 
Decide when and where you will test out your thought. Try to be as specific as possible. Remember - if you have a specific plan, you are more likely to follow through!"
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,7,Step 2) Re-evaluate your Alternative Thought after the activity,"After you complete the activity, take another look at your alternative thought and describe the associated emotion. Did the action experiment provide information that confirmed or disconfirmed your thought? Remember to try not to think in absolutes (watch out for Black and White Thinking!). Perhaps the activity provided partial evidence for or against the thought.
 
For example, if you tested out the automatic thought ""I will have a terrible time at the party"" by going to a party, then you might have collected the following data: you felt uncomfortable on a few occasions, you enjoyed spending time with your friend, you engaged in a few interesting conversations, you enjoyed the food, and your mood was better after going to the party. So, you might conclude that your alternative thought (""If I go to the party I will enjoy myself and I will probably be glad that I went."") is 80% true. You didn't enjoy yourself the entire time, but overall you had a good time and you were glad that you went."
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,8,Step 3) Prepare for possible negative outcomes of the experiment,"It is important to prepare yourself for the possibility that the action experiment might not support your new, more helpful thought. Even though this is a risk, remember there are many potential benefits, such as:
-    the opportunity to collect more information
-    practice responding to situations differently
-    the possibility of believing your new alternative thought more deeply.
-    Being more active"
Lesson #10: Action Experiments,9,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Just because you came up with an alternative thought, doesn’t always mean it will “feel right.” Sometimes you have to “test” these thoughts out by creating an “Action Experiment.” An action experiment is an activity you plan to help gather information about an alternative thought you created or gain additional evidence against a negative automatic thought you had.  

Moving forward: The action experiment combines ideas learned from the Activity and Thought Trackers. It may not be applicable in all cases – but give it a try and see if it helps. Before you move on to the next lesson, make sure to complete one action experiment before moving on. You can use the Activity Tracker to schedule the activity. You can even tag the activity as an “Action Experiment” if that would be helpful to keep track of it."
Summary #10: Action Experiments,1,,"Action Experiments help you gather data that tests the alternative thoughts you generate. We often need supporting data, through repeated experiences, to believe our new alternative thoughts. Action experiments allow you to get this data if you need it. Even if you already believe your alternative thought, practicing a behavior that is consistent with an alternative thought can have positive benefits in and of themselves. Just follow the three steps to creating an action experiment: planning an activity, re-evaluating your alternative thought after the activity, and preparing for possible negative outcomes. Remember, testing an alternative thought requires taking a risk, but even if your thought is only partially supported, there are still a lot of benefits that come from action experiments. "
Lesson #11: Coping,1,,"“Coping” refers to the things you do to manage stressful situations. Some coping strategies are healthy because they help you feel better in the long-term. Other coping strategies are unhealthy because they may lead to more stress. Learning effective, healthy coping strategies is an important way to reduce your depression and shape the life you want.

This lesson will teach you about:
-    What coping is and how it works
-    How to choose an effective coping strategy for specific types of problems
-    A new coping strategy: acceptance
 "
Lesson #11: Coping,2,What coping is and how it works,"The term “coping” has many different meanings. We define coping as an individual’s efforts to manage stressful situations. People can cope in healthy and unhealthy ways. This lesson will help you identify healthy coping strategies for managing stressful circumstances.

Your Coping Toolbox
Although this is the first time we have used the word “coping,” you have actually been developing coping skills throughout the entire ThinkFeelDo program. In fact, all of the CBT strategies you have been learning are types of healthy coping strategies. Essentially, ThinkFeelDo has helped you to build a “coping toolbox.” This coping toolbox contains some core skills (e.g., scheduling positive activities, identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts, identifying patterns in your mood and behaviors, tapping into signature strengths) as well as skills that are specific to your needs (e.g., assertive communication or relaxation training). By having a toolbox full of several different strategies, you are better prepared to deal with various types of stressors. This lesson will provide some suggestions to help you choose the most effective coping strategy for a given situation. We will also introduce a new coping strategy, acceptance, at the end of the lesson.

 "
Lesson #11: Coping,3,How to choose an effective coping strategy for specific types of problems,"Step 1: Defining the problem: controllable vs. uncontrollable
The first step in choosing an effective coping strategy is to break down the problem into smaller parts. As you break down the problem, identify which aspects of the situation are under your control and which aspects are not. Usually stressors have both uncontrollable and controllable aspects. Even problems that initially seem very large and uncontrollable often have some aspects of the situation that are controllable. Breaking down the situation in this way will help you to determine the best coping strategies to use for the different aspects of the problem. For example, if you have an argument with a co-worker, you can control how you behave towards your co-worker afterwards, what you do to reduce your anger, and how you behave with your other co-workers. However, there are other aspects of this situation that are not under your control, such as the fact that you had the argument, and the reactions, thoughts, or feelings of your co-worker."
Lesson #11: Coping,4,Defining the problem: controllable vs. uncontrollable,"Now, let's give you some examples of the controllable and uncontrollable aspects of the following situations:

Situation #1:Your car breaks down on the way to work

Controllable (things that you can exert authority over):
-    Call a tow truck
-    Keeping calm during this inconvenience
-    Call the office to let them know you will be late

Uncontrollable (things that are completely beyond your reach):
-    The fact that you will be late to work
-    Length of time it takes for tow truck to arrive
-    Extent of damage to your car"
Lesson #11: Coping,5,Defining the problem: controllable vs. uncontrollable,"There are a lot of different kinds of situations that are beyond your control

Take a look at another example...
 

Situation #2: You are diagnosed with a chronic illness

Controllable:
-    Choosing a good doctor
-    Deciding on medication or procedures

Uncontrollable:
-    The fact that you have the illness
-    The need for medical follow-up"
Lesson #11: Coping,6,Step 2: Coping Responses: Problem-focused vs. Emotion-focused,"The second step involved in choosing an effective coping strategy is to match the appropriate coping style with the controllable and uncontrollable aspects of the situation. In order to do this, you first need to understand the difference between two categories of coping styles: problem-focused and emotion-focused. Problem-focused coping involves doing something that changes the problem or an aspect of a problem that is causing distress. Problem-focused coping may involve: planning, decision making, conflict resolution, information or advice seeking, goal setting, or problem solving. Emotion-focused coping involves managing your emotional response to a stressful situation. Emotion-focused strategies could involve: challenging unhelpful thoughts about the situation, emotional expression, scheduling positive activities, or physical stress reduction (exercising, relaxation, deep breathing). So, problem-focused coping is aimed at changing the situation itself and emotion-focused coping is aimed at managing your emotional reaction to the situation."
Lesson #11: Coping,7,Coping Responses: Problem-focused vs. Emotion-focused,"Here are some examples of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies:
 

Situation: You feel disappointed after receiving a bad grade on an exam. Problem-focused coping might involve scheduling time each week to study at the library or asking for advice on how to better prepare for the next test. Emotion-focused coping might involve telling yourself “dwelling on it won’t do any good, so I will go for a bike ride to lift my mood”.

Situation: You learn that your hours are going to be cut at work. Problem-focused coping might involve limiting unnecessary spending, updating your resume, applying for new positions. Emotion-focused coping might involve calling a friend to vent about your frustrations, practice deep breathing, and reframe catastrophic worries about your financial situation

 "
Lesson #11: Coping,8,Step 3: Matching the Coping Strategy to the Situation,"The next step in choosing an effective coping strategy is to match the type of situation (controllable or uncontrollable) with the coping style (problem-focused or emotion-focused).

Changeable or controllable aspects of a stressor are best dealt with using problem-focused behaviors. If there is something you can do to fix the problem, it is usually better to do it.

Unchangeable or uncontrollable aspects of a stressor may be best dealt with by using emotion-focused coping strategies. If you can't fix the problem, then it is better to manage your reaction to the problem.

Essentially, you have to match the coping strategy to the situation. A poor fit, or a mismatch between the stressful situation(controllable vs. uncontrollable) and the coping behaviors used (problem-focused vs. emotion-focused) can lead to increased stress. Most situations have both controllable and uncontrollable aspects, so for most situations you will end up using both problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies."
Lesson #11: Coping,9,Example of Matching the Coping Strategy to the Situation,"For example, if you lose your job, you can express your frustrations about the job loss and exercise to manage stress (emotion-focused coping). However, if you continue to focus on managing your emotions without taking any action towards finding a new job, you are likely to feel more frustrated and upset in the long run. If, on the other hand, you take steps to look for a new job (problem-focused coping) in addition to expressing your feelings and exercising (emotion-focused coping), you are likely to start feeling better."
Lesson #11: Coping,10,Other coping strategies,"Sometimes situations feel so overwhelming that people choose to cope with them by using distraction or denial. These strategies often feel good in the short-run, and may even be helpful when used short-term. In the long-run, however, they are generally ineffective and, in the extreme, may be harmful.

Distraction
Distraction involves temporarily removing your attention from a problem or upsetting emotions. The key to distraction being an effective coping strategy is that it is ""temporary"" and you eventually turn your attention to more active coping strategies. Distraction can be helpful because it can reduce overwhelming emotions so that you are better able to deal directly with the situation later. Examples of healthy distraction techniques include reading a good book, watching a movie, exercise, household chores, treating yourself to a massage, or focusing on your breathing. When distraction is used as a long-term coping strategy, it often leads to more upsetting emotions because it avoids dealing directly with the problem. For example, distracting yourself when you are anxious about an upcoming test by watching a movie might help in the moment and can even be beneficial if it allows you to unwind so that you can study more effectively later. However, if you continue to distract yourself before the exam, you'll be even more anxious because you feel unprepared.

Denial
Denial is a conscious or unconscious attempt to avoid facing a problem or strong emotions.
Examples of denial include, hiding/stuffing your feelings, excessive alcohol use, drug use, overeating, procrastination, missing doctor appointments, or not taking medications. Although these strategies might help you feel better immediately, they can lead to physical and emotional harm in the long-term."
Lesson #11: Coping,11,Lesson #11: Coping,"Acceptance
Sometimes you are left with painful emotions, even after applying the appropriate coping strategies and working through the situation in healthy ways. For example, this is common when we lose someone we care about, either through the end of a relationship or death. So, how do you deal with the remaining pain that is left after you have exhausted your coping efforts? The key is to focus on accepting the painful emotions and allowing yourself to feel them. People often respond to this type of emotional pain or any type of discomfort by building a wall of tightness around it and defending against it. The problem with this strategy is that the more you resist pain, the more it hurts. For example, think about receiving an injection. If it hurts or you anticipate it hurting, you might resist it by tensing your muscles. This only causes the injection to hurt more. And so you have a vicious cycle of pain and resistance.

(Adapted from M. Davis, E. Eshelman, and M. McKay, The Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook, 4th ed., Oakland CA: New Harbinger, 1995.)"
Lesson #11: Coping,12,Wrapping Up,"Summary: “Coping” refers to the ways that you deal with stressful situations. This includes both healthy forms of coping, that make you feel better in the short and long-term and unhealthy forms of coping that may or may not make you feel better in the short-term but will often make things worse in the long-term. Developing healthy coping strategies is an important part of managing your depression. It’s useful to break a stressful situations into parts and determine which parts are controllable and which parts are uncontrollable. For controllable stressors, problem-focused coping (directly addressing part or all of the problem) is most effective. For uncontrollable stressors it is often better to use emotion-focused coping that focuses on managing your emotions.   

Moving forward: Practice using the tools available to you to cope with a difficult situation.  Perhaps you could schedule some activities in the Activity Tracker that would be using active coping. Maybe try using the Thought Tracker to find acceptance about a tough problem.  Get creative.  This is your toolbox – use it!"
Summary #11: Coping,1,,"Coping refers to the efforts you make to manage the stressful things in your life, and there are a few steps you can take to help you cope in a healthy and effective way. The first step is to break the problem into smaller parts, and define those parts as controllable or uncontrollable. Then, match each part of the problem with an appropriate response: problem- or emotion-focused. Problem-focused coping strategies are usually best suited for controllable parts of a stressor or problem, while emotion-focused coping strategies work well with uncontrollable aspects. If, after you’ve exhausted all your available coping strategies, you still experience emotional discomfort or pain, it is sometimes helpful to simply accept those emotions. In situations where there are no solutions, as in the loss of a loved one, allowing yourself to feel your emotions can be more of a relief than resisting them."
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,1,,"Most of us get anxious about everyday problems. However, you know you are worrying too much when your worries are constantly on your mind and you notice that you worry about things that others don't. Anxiety can also lead to uncomfortable physical problems such as headaches, fatigue, or stomach discomfort.

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
 -   How to identify unhealthy worry and anxiety.
 -   Skills to manage excessive anxiety.
 "
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,2,Anxiety and Worry,"Feeling sad and depressed often go hand in hand with feeling anxious and worried. In fact, up to 60% of people who have depression also suffer from anxiety. Excessive anxiety can lead to a negative mood and can also make it difficult to focus on tasks. Some people also experience physical effects of anxiety, such as muscle tension, headaches, or an upset stomach. This lesson will introduce some new ways to deal with worry by changing your thoughts and behavior."
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,3,Understanding Anxiety,"Anxiety is our body's way of preparing for danger. It's often called the ""fight or flight"" response because when we're faced with a dangerous situation, the basic response is to fight back, freeze, or run away. Anxiety can be helpful, like an alarm bell, so we would not want to turn off our anxiety completely. On the other hand, we would be exhausted if our alarm bells were going off all of the time. Before we discuss how to manage these feelings, it is important to distinguish between anxiety, fear, and worry, since for many of us, these may feel like similar emotions. But in fact they are different in important ways:"
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,4,Understanding Anxiety,"Remember the cognitive/behavioral model for depression? The same model applies to anxiety. When we are anxious our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors link together in the same way.

Just like sad emotions often come with unhelpful thoughts, anxiety is also linked to unhelpful thoughts. When we face a situation, we feel anxious when we think that: The situation is threatening to us or to someone or something important to us. We have little (or no) skills or resources to deal with the situation. These unhelpful thoughts cause our anxiety system to set off a false alarm, causing anxiety, worry, and tension."
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,5,Here's an example:,"Imagine you're walking down a path.  A tiger jumps out of the bushes.  How do you feel?  Probably terrified.

Now try it again.  But this time imagine walking down the same path but carrying a large walking stick and a walkie-talkie that connects you with a park ranger.  The tiger jumps out.  How do you feel? Pretty scared, but maybe a little bit better than you did when you didn't have your walking stick or walkie-talkie.

Now one last time... You're on the same path. You have a walking stick and a walkie-talkie.  But you're also with a group of 20 other hikers who all have walking sticks, a trained guide and 3 guards who's job it is to keep the path safe.  A tiger jumps out.  How do you feel?  Maybe scared, but maybe a little excited too.  Not many people get to see a tiger so close!

In these different scenarios, what changed?  Not the risk, because the tiger is the same. What changed is how you're thinking about the situation. You have different resources available to deal with the risk.  In order to deal effectively with anxiety, we need to identify the risk and determine what resources you have to cope.  By fortifying your resources, you can reduce anxiety."
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,6,Identifying Helpful and Unhelpful Anxiety,"When dealing with a tiger, anxiety and fear are a helpful response because they get you ready to fight or run away. However, in most situations in modern life, the actual danger is not so clear cut as a tiger staring into your cave. For example, your boss is not likely to threaten your physical safety, but he may present a different, more subtle kind of threat. In these every day situations, like having problems at work, anxiety arises from unhelpful thoughts that make the situation feel more dangerous than it actually is. In addition, when people feel anxious and perceive danger, they often underestimate the resources they have to cope with the problem. This type of anxiety is unhelpful because it causes a false alarm. The remainder of this lesson will focus on techniques to help you manage anxiety and worry."
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,7,What is the real risk?,"Remember the concept of “Automatic Thoughts.” When people feel anxious and perceive danger, they often have unhelpful automatic thoughts. These thoughts tend to overestimate risk and underestimate the resources they have to cope with the problem. The first step in managing anxiety is to evaluate these thoughts. Is there real risk involved? If you conclude that there is no actual risk, then there is no need for a false alarm. However, if you do determine there is some degree of risk, then your goal is to determine the realistic level of risk and move to step 2: Gather resources to overcome that risk (like, gathering your torches and big sticks)."
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,8,Step 1: Evaluating risk and thoughts,"In addition to estimating the probability of a catastrophic outcome, you can evaluate the realistic level of risk. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help determine your risk:
-    Am I making a problem out of something that's not an immediate problem?
-    Is this situation actually risky or does it just feel that way?
-    What's the evidence that this situation is 100% dangerous?
-    What does this say about me, my life, and my future?
-    What is the worst thing that could happen?
-    What is the best thing that could happen?
-    Am I worrying over something I have no control over?"
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,9,Step 2: Identify your resources to cope,"The last step in managing anxiety is to take a look at what resources we have to cope. We face situations that have some degree of risk each day, but we only have anxiety when that level of risk outweighs our ability to cope. To reduce anxiety, it is helpful to determine all of your resources available to help you cope with the threatening situation. Here are some questions to help you identify your resources:
-  What personal and professional skills do I have to help manage this problem?
-  What have I done to cope with problems like this in the past?
-  Who do I have in my life to help me out?
-  What other people do I have in my life to help me deal with this?
-  How would I cope with this if I wasn't feeling anxious?
-  How would someone else (who isn't anxious) handle the situation?"
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,10,How to manage anxiety when the realistic probability of risk is high?,"In some situations, the realistic risk of a poor outcome is high and you might not be catastrophizing. In these situations, you might need to use some problem-solving strategies and focus on your resources to cope."
Lesson #12: Anxiety and Worry,11,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Anxiety is a normal part of human experience. We all get anxious, however, if you get anxious too often or in situations where no threat actually exists, this can leave you feeling overwhelmed or exhausted overtime. Managing your anxiety involves using the skills you’ve learned so far to decide if the anxiety is helpful or unhelpful and managing unhelpful anxiety when it occurs.

Moving forward: Try using the Thought Tracker to focus on anxiety related thoughts.  Use the risk vs resources concept to develop your helpful thoughts. The more you use the tool, the easier it will be to evaluate your risk from a realistic perspective and focus on your resources to cope with the situation."
Summary #12: Anxiety and Worry,1,,"We can feel anxious if a situation arises that makes us think we are (a) threatened and/or (b) don’t have the skills to deal with that situation. Anxiety and worry are normal parts of our lives, but when we spend too much time worrying it can have negative effects on our mental and physical health. The majority of individuals experiencing depression also experience anxiety, and this excessive anxiety often contributes to a low or bad mood. But just as the cognitive/behavioral model can help combat the negative thoughts associated with depression, it can also be utilized to manage anxiety. First, identify and evaluate the potential risks of the situation (and the probability of their occurrence); second, identify the resources you have to manage the identified risks. This process will help correct any overestimation of risk and underestimation of resources, reducing your anxiety along the way!"
Lesson #13: Relaxation,1,,"This lesson will help you learn how to manage your physical responses to anxiety. A great way to control the sensations of anxiety like a racing heart and muscle tension is through relaxation. You've probably heard how taking a few deep breaths can help you to calm down when you feel nervous The relaxation lesson will teach you the best ways to breath in order to respond to the physical cues of anxiety as well as other techniques to help you stay calm.

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
-    How your body creates and reduces the experience of stress
-    3 different relaxation strategies
-    Tips for practicing these new strategies"
Lesson #13: Relaxation,2,,"Many of the skills in ThinkFeelDo aim to reduce stress by helping you stop it before it starts. However, learning these skills does not mean you’ll never get stressed. Relaxation is a skill that helps after stress occurs. Relaxation skills can be used to manage many problems including stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep problems.

How the body creates and reduces the experience of stress
Our nervous system has two parts- the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. These two systems are like an internal thermostat that controls our stress response.
-    The Sympathetic Nervous System is similar to a heating system. When you experience stress, you become aroused and stress hormones are produced. These stress hormones increase the physical reactions to stress like heart rate, breathing, muscle tension, blood pressure, and sweating.
-    The Parasympathetic Nervous System acts as a cooling system. It brings the body reactions back to normal by producing a relaxation response that slows down the heart rate and breathing, relaxes the muscles, and lowers blood pressure."
Lesson #13: Relaxation,3,Experiencing Stress,"Our bodies are biologically programmed to activate the sympathetic nervous system when we confront stressful situations. This system of arousal was very helpful in ancient times. Imagine an early human walking through a jungle. She suddenly sees a huge poisonous snake in her path, and it’s threatening to bite her. Her stress system kicks in, she becomes highly alert, and begins experiencing the following physiological symptoms:
-    heart starts pumping blood to get oxygen to the muscles
-    muscles become tense and ready for action
-    breathing increases to help oxygen flow
-    sweat glands are stimulated
-    blood pressure increases
-    all of the body’s systems are ready for fight or flight.

Today those same stress systems get triggered when you are irritated by traffic, your partner, being put on hold for the third time in a row. In fact, you can even have a stress reaction just by remembering something stressful."
Lesson #13: Relaxation,4,Chronic Stress,"Over time, this physiological response can take a toll on our body if it is repeated on a regular basis. When people experience chronic stress they are at risk for long-term negative health effects. Eventually your adrenal glands start to secret corticoids (adrenaline or epinephrine, and norepinephrine), which inhibit digestion, reproduction, growth, tissue repair, and the responses of your immune and inflammatory systems. In other words, some very important functions that keep your body healthy begin to shut down!"
Lesson #13: Relaxation,5,Reducing Stress,"Just as the sympathetic nervous system turns on the stress response, the parasympathetic nervous system can turn it off. The parasympathetic system allows your body to wind down and recuperate. When the parasympathetic system kicks in, your body begins to experience the following physiological symptoms:
-    Heart rate slows
-    Muscles relax
-    Breathing becomes slower
-    Blood pressure decreases"
Lesson #13: Relaxation,6,How can I learn to relax?,"Next, we will present 3 different relaxation exercises. Not every person will be comfortable with every relaxation method. Although we are only introducing 3 exercises in this module, there are many more relaxation strategies out there that might be beneficial to you."
Lesson #13: Relaxation,7,1. Deep Breathing: ,"Deep breathing involves breathing from the diaphragm, the muscle you hiccup with, to expand your lungs more fully than your usual breathing, which expands only the chest. The best way to notice that difference between deep breathing and chest breathing is to sit in a comfortable position and put one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach. Slowly inhale through your nose. As you inhale, focus on expanding your stomach, almost as though you’re inflating a balloon in your abdomen, while keeping your chest as stationary as possible. The hand on your stomach should be moving in and out, while the hand on your chest barely moves. Slowly exhale the breath through your mouth and try again."
Lesson #13: Relaxation,8,2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):,"Ever felt like your body was more relaxed after being very physically active? This technique is based on the idea that you can achieve greater relaxation after you’ve worked a muscle than you otherwise would have. PMR involves alternately tensing and relaxing muscles in order to learn the process of experiencing tension and then releasing it. Try moving through all the muscle groups, from your face down to your feet, and purposefully tense and release each muscle group. Note that, as you’re focusing your attention on muscle groups, your attention may also be drawn to any pain in the muscles. In general, it’s a good idea to skip over the muscles in any part of your body that are feeling pain as well as tension."
Lesson #13: Relaxation,9,3. Visualization:,"This technique encourages you to focus on a specific image or place. A common visualization exercise involves imagining a relaxing place. This might be a beach, or a forest, or even your own backyard. The goal is to imagine this place in great detail and to incorporate all five of your senses when picturing this lovely place. What would you see, hear, taste, smell, and feel? The more detail you can build into your visualization, the more effective it can be in helping you relax.

 "
Lesson #13: Relaxation,10,,"For all these types of relaxation, it’s a good idea to practice them, at least a few times, with as few distractions as possible. Find a quiet place where others won’t disturb you. Often it helps to practice these exercises with your eyes shut or, if that bothers you, open and greatly defocuse. Arranging your body comfortably can also be helpful: sitting in a comfortable chair or on a soft rug, or lying down on a bed, is often preferred. Finally, remember that relaxation is something to be learned and practiced; be okay with starting each of these exercises slowly (2-3 minutes) and working your way to longer practices from there. After you’ve practiced these techniques and gotten better at doing them it will be easier to use them in real-world stressful situations."
Lesson #13: Relaxation,11,Relaxation Exercises,"As you can see from these three exercises, relaxation comes in many forms. What they have in common is focused attention and controlled breathing. As stated at the beginning of this chapter, the most important parts of relaxation are finding out what method works best for you and using it regularly. Other forms of relaxation that may be helpful for you are mindfulness meditation, yoga, exercise, and prayer, such as focusing on a particular religious passage that provides you with comfort. Select a relaxation strategy that sounds like it might work for you and give it a try!

Tips for Practicing
-    You can monitor your response to the different relaxation exercises by keeping a log. Doing this will help you monitor your progress and see how relaxation can reduce your tension.

-    To keep track of how you feel before and after your relaxation exercises, rate your tension before and after the exercise using a ten-point scale where 1 = no tension and 10 = as tense as one could possibly feel."
Lesson #13: Relaxation,12,Wrapping Up,"Summary: This stress response and our recovery from it are controlled by two parts of the nervous system. Together, these systems should help you respond to stressful situations and cool you down when the stressful situation has passed. Unfortunately, repeated or chronic stress can break the thermostat, leaving you feeling stressed much of the time.  Relaxation is a way of manually resetting the biological thermostat and getting the cooling system going. Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization, among others, are good exercises for learning and practicing relaxation skills.

Moving Forward: This week you learned how relaxation can help improve your mood and decrease stress and anxiety. Plan some times to practice relaxation within the next week – if you can practice daily that would be great! You can use the Activity Tracker to schedule times to practice relaxation.   "
Summary #13: Relaxation,1,,"Practicing relaxation and mindfulness is necessary in maintaining a healthy body, mind, and spirit, and it can help manage stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep. Our nervous system is made up of two smaller systems: (1) the sympathetic and (2) the parasympathetic. Both influence the way our bodies respond to stress. They work together and are controlled by an internal ""thermostat."" The sympathetic nervous system turns up the thermostat, so our bodies can respond to a stressful situation. This is called the ""Stress Response."" The parasympathetic nervous system turns down the thermostat, so our bodies can adjust back to normal after the stressful situation ends. This is called the ""Relaxation Response."" Experiencing stress is natural and can be useful.  Acute stress is a reaction that cools down quickly (e.g., experiencing a fender bender) and is useful for handling stressful situations. Chronic stress occurs when you are frequently/continually stressed, which can cause your thermostat to break. Your parasympathic nervous system can no longer cool you down. This can leave you stressed much of the time, even when nothing threatening is occurring. The following are 3 relaxation techniques to manage stress: deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), and visualization. "
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,1,,"Mindfulness is about learning to focus our attention in a non judgmental way and figuring out how to let go of negative thoughts and feelings. Anxiety is often triggered by thinking about things that might happen in the future. Mindfulness combats that by teaching you to stay “in the moment.”

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
-  What mindfulness is and how it can be helpful
-  Specific types of mindfulness skills to help you cope with distress
-  How to practice these skills"
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,2,,"Basically, mindfulness helps us balance two extremes - acting without awareness in unhelpful ways and taking a judgmental stance toward our experiences. Instead, we can learn to notice and observe our internal experiences, like thoughts and feelings, seeing them as they are while accepting things we cannot control and bringing our attention to the present and what needs to be addressed. Learning to use mindfulness can allow us avoid extremes and adopt a more balanced perspective."
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,3,What is Mindfulness?,"In this lesson we will talk about the role of awareness in the process of helping you lead a healthier life. This process of awareness, or as we will call it, mindfulness, is essentially the process of focusing our attention in a nonjudgmental way on what is happening inside and around us in the present moment. Usually we live our lives focused on what will come in the future - for example with worries and anxiety about what is to come, or focused on the past - for example with depression when we replay mistakes and upsetting events over and over in our minds. We can spend all this time looking at what has not happened yet or what cannot be changed in the past while not being focused on what is right before us in the present. Often we do this automatically, without really paying attention to what we are doing."
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,4,How can Mindfulness be helpful?,"It’s often helpful to be able to do things automatically, without thinking about them, for instance riding a bike is much easier when you don’t have to think about maintaining your balance or turning the pedals. However, this tendency to do things automatically can also be problematic. We can develop unhealthy habits or lose sight of what we care about. And sometimes, when we pay close attention to our experiences we can become judgmental or critical of them. For instance, we might evaluate our performance at work or in some other role with thoughts like “I am so stupid”, “I completely messed that up”, or “I am such a loser, I know I’ll fail”. This focus on judgment can intensify how badly we feel and lead us away from dealing with the problem at hand."
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,5,Origins and Applications of Mindfulness,"Mindfulness has its origins in the ancient practice of Buddhist meditation. However, using mindfulness skills does not have to involve religious practice. In fact, over the past several decades, mindfulness has become the focus of extensive scientific research. Mindfulness can be useful for a variety of health and medical problems including depression, anxiety, chronic pain, management of stress, insomnia and heart disease, high blood pressure, autoimmune disease, and more. In fact, researchers are studying the effects of mindfulness on the functioning of the brain in order to understand how the positive effects on health are created. So although these are ancient skills, mindfulness appears to be a research-supported method of helping you feel better."
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,6,"Mindfulness is not some kind of ""trick""","It is an evidence-based technique that can be used to help with lots of problems, depression among them. Recent research shows that practicing mindfulness is related to changes in the way the brain works. Areas of the brain related to emotion are less active the more people practice mindfulness. Mindfulness practice may help people better regulate the emotional parts their brains. Let’s turn to learning about specific kinds of mindfulness skills and practicing some."
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,7,Basic Mindfulness Skills,"The goal of using mindfulness in this lesson is different from the goals of most of the other lessons in ThinkFeelDo. Many other lessons have focused on specific skills to reduce depression. The focus of this module is on helping you to “step out of” or let go of unhelpful automatic ways of thinking so that you can be more effective in your life. The focus is not specifically on reducing or getting rid of unpleasant feelings such as sadness, anxiety, or anger. Instead, mindfulness might reduce these feelings by not giving too much power to them. If this seems confusing, we ask that you give it a try and see what it is like."
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,8,Goals of Mindfulness,"Since we will not focus on decreasing unpleasant feelings, you may be wondering “What am I going to be learning?”. There are a number of goals that we will help you to reach in this life lesson. First, as we mentioned before, using mindfulness will help you be in a state of focused attention in the present moment. Second, you will develop more awareness of your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. It is through increased awareness that we can begin to let go of them. Third, we will help you to become more of a “detached observer” who is more accepting of your experiences."
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,9,,"We will help you learn mindfulness not just by explaining and describing it, but by asking you to learn by doing it. Visit your Connect Discussion question so that you can try out a few exercises. That will help you practice!

Keep these questions in mind as you proceed:
1.    Did you notice your mind pulling you away from what you were focusing on?
2.    Were you able to bring your attention back?"
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,10,More on Mindfulness,"If you have had experience with mindfulness practice before, perhaps this lesson has been a review for you. However, if this is your introduction to mindfulness, we hope that this has been helpful and has at the very least made you interested in doing more. At this point it is helpful to recall the goals of doing this lesson. Remember, mindfulness is all about developing and focusing awareness of your experience in the current moment. It is not about decreasing or getting rid of unpleasant experiences. Keep in mind that a key part of depression, and many other problems, is feeling stuck in negative emotions and thoughts. And when we are stuck in these experiences it is hard to take the action that we need to solve problems and do the meaningful things in life. Mindfulness is a way to help you get unhooked from these experiences and take action. Like other skills you have learned in ThinkFeelDo, mindfulness requires practice. The more you do it, the easier it will get. And the better you will be at focusing awareness. One of the great things about practicing mindfulness is that you can be mindful of almost anything! "
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,11,Practice being mindful!,"Be mindful while doing the following:
-    eating
-    sitting in a chair
-    taking a shower, notice the temperature of the water, what the soap feels like, etc
-    drinking your favorite beverage
-    while standing, notice sensations
-    taking a walk, notice all aspects of the activity
-    writing, either with your hand or on a keyboard
-    listening to music
-    doing the dishes

There is almost no end to the things we can be more mindful about."
Lesson #14: Mindfulness,12,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Mindfulness is a skill that involves becoming more focused on the present moment. Mindfulness is about letting go of thoughts about the past and future and adopting a nonjudgmental stance. Mindfulness can be hard at first, but because it can be applied to almost anything, we have many opportunities to practice mindfulness.

Moving forward: This week you learned how mindfulness can help improve your mood and decrease depression. Plan some times to practice mindfulness within the next week – if you can practice daily that would be great!  You may not even need to add a new activity.  Try being more mindful during an activity you already do (like taking a shower, eating breakfast, doing the dishes). You could use the Activity Tracker to schedule your mindfulness activites.  

 "
Summary #14: Mindfulness,1,,"Mindfulness is a Buddhist meditation practice now supported by research to help manage emotions. Mindfulness helps you (1) be in a state of focused attention in the moment, (2) develop awareness of your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations to begin to let go of troubling responses, and (3) be a “detached observer”, becoming more accepting of your experiences. A key part of depression is feeling stuck in negative emotions and thoughts. It can be difficult to take action to solve problems and do meaningful things in life. Mindfulness helps you get unhooked from these experiences."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,1,,"Depression is not just about feeling sad or losing interest in things. When people are feeling down or depressed they can frequently feel irritable, finding that even little things get on their nerves, or find they are frequently getting into arguments with others. While these feelings are not necessarily a problem if they occur occasionally, frequent or chronic anger can have important negative consequences for you and others. So in this lesson we will help you learn how to decrease your anger so you feel better.

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
-    The costs and benefits of anger
-    How your thinking contributes to anger
-    Specific skills for coping with and decreasing anger"
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,2,The costs and benefits of anger,"The Short Term Benefits of Anger
Getting angry may seem like it provides you with some benefits: Anger can be a way to release tension. You are frustrated or annoyed with others so you yell, break things, or criticize. You feel better, but only temporarily. You get irritated again. Anger can get the attention of others so you feel like you are being taken seriously or being heard or respected. However, others can get annoyed by this and gradually shut you out even more. Anger is often easier to cope with than feelings of sadness, hurt, or shame, which may be under the surface. But avoiding these other feelings won't make them better. The feelings can get worse. Getting angry at someone for their mistakes can make us feel like we are getting even or making things fair. They hurt you, you hurt them. But is making enemies what you really want? So while anger may help you feel better immediately, it can end up creating much bigger and more long-term problems. Let's look now at some additional costs of anger."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,3,Costs of Anger,"Physiological Costs: Anger is not good for your health. Decades of medical research have shown that chronic anger and hostility have been linked to high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart disease. Chronic anger is related to more use of alcohol.

Emotional and Interpersonal Costs: Research over the past several decades has shown that chronic anger damages personal relationships with family and friends. It keeps others away so people feel lonely and don't get the support they need. It can damage work relationships and performance."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,4,How your thinking contributes to anger: Understanding events and cues that trigger anger,"Often, emotions, including anger, seem to come out of nowhere. We may suddenly feel a strong surge of anger but not understand where it came from. Anger does not appear out of nowhere. We feel it because something in our lives has triggered it. If we become more aware of the events that can trigger our anger, we can do more to manage it rather than have anger manage us.

Sensitive issues: We often get angry because an event has touched on a sensitive issue in our lives. For example, someone who was teased and ridiculed by others while growing up may be more likely to respond with anger to negative comments about his work performance. Anger may be a ""red flag"" for this person to start thinking that they are being judged or attacked.

Recollection of a past event: Thinking about something that happened in the past can be enough to trigger anger now. For instance, if someone is meeting a friend out for lunch and the friend is not there, the person may start getting angry just thinking about past situations where others were late or did not show up for a planned get together."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,5,Understanding Cues to Anger,"It is important to be aware of cues or warning signs that your anger is growing...

Physical: You may notice physical sensations that signal our bodies' response to anger. Common sensations are an increase in heart rate, chest tightness, increased rate of breathing, and a warm or flushed feeling.

Behavioral: Our behavior changes when anger is growing. We may raise our voices or ""snap"" at others. We may start slamming doors or become physically destructive. Also, we may clench our fists or find it difficult to sit or stand still. We may become more active than usual or behave in aggressive ways."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,6,Understanding Cues to Anger,"Emotional: When we feel angry, we often feel other emotions as well. These other emotions may be important reactions to the event that triggered your anger. And they can be helpful cues to you that your anger is growing. Important emotional cues include feeling anxious, impatient, rejected, abandoned, guilty, insecure, or jealous.

Thinking: Our thinking changes when we are angry. We begin to interpret situations in specific ways. For example, if we interpret the feedback of others as blame for a mistake, then we are more likely to become angry. We may ""talk to ourselves"" with our thinking. This thinking is often hostile and critical. Additionally, we have images or desires that enter our minds that signal an increase in anger. For example, we may start making plans for revenge against someone we believe has hurt us."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,7,Understanding Your Angry Thinking,"As you have learned before, our emotions have a lot to do with our thinking. Whether it be sadness, worry, or anger, these emotions are fueled by what is going through our mind at the time. And just as with other emotions common to depression, such as sadness, there tend to be characteristic ways of thinking that can give rise to anger. Let's learn about these ways of thinking now."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,8,Angry Unhelpful Thoughts,"Our angry thoughts tend to be characterized by a basic formula:
1.    You believe or sense that you are being threatened or harmed in some way.
2.    You believe that someone has violated “the rules” - that what they have done is wrong and should not have happened.
3.    There is usually a sense that the other person intended to harm you on purpose or deliberately.

1+2+3 = Anger

This is the “formula” for anger. Just like when you are feeling sad or depressed, while these unhelpful thoughts may be true some of the time, often, these thoughts are not true or are exaggerated. They also don’t help you solve the problem."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,9,Understanding the Formula for Angry Unhelpful Thoughts,"Here is an example of how to break down your angry thought using the formula:

Angry Unhelpful Thought: “This is ridiculous that my wife left the gas tank practically on empty even though she drove the car last! Now I have to do it.”

1) Belief that you are being threatened or harmed in some way

Threat = having to get the gas

2) Belief that someone has violated “the rules”
Violated Rule = She drove the car last so she should fill up the tank
 

3) Harmful intention
Intention = She knew she would be expected to fill up the tank but left it for you"
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,10,The Anger Formula: Another Example,"Angry Unhelpful Thought: “They keep dumping all of this extra work for me to do on this new big project. I’m so sick of them doing this!”
1) Threat = Having to do more work
2) Violated Rules = It’s their work and they are supposed to do it
3) Intention = They know it is theirs to take care of but they are trying to get out of their responsibilities.

Understanding this formula assists you in identifying the thoughts or the expectations that lead you to feel angry."
Lesson #15: Managing Anger,11,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Anger is an emotion that is typically associated with feelings of depression. Feelings of anger are normal, but feeling angry too often or acting on those feelings in ways that you will later regret can lead to more and bigger problems. Understanding the thoughts that contribute to feelings of anger, especially using the 1-2-3 (Threat-Violated Rules-Intention) Anger Formula, is a helpful way to learn to be more in control of your emotions.

Moving forward:  The Thought Tracker is a great place to work through your angry thoughts.  Try it out this week."
Summary #15: Managing Anger,1,,"When people are down they frequently feel irritable or angry. Frequent or chronic anger can have negative consequences for you and others.

Anger can be a way to release tension. You feel better, but only temporarily. Others can get annoyed by your anger and gradually shut you out. Anger is often easier to cope with than feelings of sadness, hurt, or shame that may be under the surface.

Chronic anger and hostility have been linked to high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart disease, more use of alcohol, and damage to personal relationships and work performance.

We may suddenly feel a strong surge of anger but not understand where it came from. We often get angry because an event has touched on a sensitive issue in our lives.

You may notice physical, behavioral, and emotional sensations that signal your anger. Our thinking changes when we are angry too. We begin to interpret situations in specific ways. We also may ""talk to ourselves"" with our thinking. This thinking is often hostile and critical.

Our angry thoughts tend to be characterized by a basic formula:
1.You believe or sense that you are being threatened or harmed in some way.
2.You believe that someone has violated “the rules” - that what they have done is wrong and should not have happened.
3.There is usually a sense that the other person intended to harm you on purpose or deliberately."
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,1,,"Guilt is a common reaction when a person feels like they’ve done something wrong. Guilt can be unhealthy when it is too intense or lasts too long based on what you’ve done or when it results in unhealthy behaviors. Shame is like guilt, but involves not only feelings of regrets after a mistake but also a belief that the mistake means something about you as a person. Managing guilt, shame, and regret is not easy.  It’s never easy to make a mistake, but because no one is perfect, it’s a part of life and learning strategies to manage these feelings is an important way to improve your mood and life.  

In this lesson you'll learn:
-    The definition of guilt and how it relates to low mood.
-    The difference between guilt and shame.
-    Strategies to manage guilt, including examining unhelpful thoughts and weighing personal responsibility."
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,2,Where does guilt come from?,"Like other emotions we have discussed, feelings of guilt stem from your thoughts and behaviors. Feelings of guilt are common among people who are feeling low.  People usually experience guilt when they think ""I did something wrong"". Typically the behavior is labeled as ""wrong"" because it is inconsistent with certain standards we have set for ourselves. This lesson is going to teach you strategies to examine mistakes and wrongdoings in a healthy and productive manner, so that you do not feel overwhelmed with guilt."
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,3,,"We discussed how mild guilt can be useful and how to move on when you have made a mistake. So, how do you tell if your feelings of guilt are excessive? The following criteria can be helpful in differentiating useful regret from dysfunctional guilt:  
-Intensity - unhealthy guilt is connected to highly negative emotions and damages one's self-esteem
-Duration – unhealthy guilt typically continues long after the original situation that made you feel guilty has passed or been resolved. You might find that you are consumed with thoughts and images of past mistakes.
-Consequences – unhealthy guilt results in unhealthy behaviors. For example, these feelings might interfere with your ability to make amends for your actions and could lead to self-destructive behaviors."
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,4,The difference between guilt and shame.,"Shame
Feelings of shame are a more extreme form of guilt and can be very damaging to a person’s self-esteem. Like guilt, shame is related to a belief that you have done something wrong. Shame indicates that not only do you believe you made a mistake, but that the mistake is a reflection of the kind of person you are. For example, you think that since you have done something wrong it means that you are “inadequate,” “damaged,” or “bad.” The idea that one is inherently flawed is a central feature of shame. Shame is typically associated with a fear that others will discover these negative characteristics. When people feel ashamed they experience an urge to avoid, run away, or hide. They believe that others will ridicule or reject them if they discover their “true” nature.
"
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,5,Coping with healthy guilt and regret,"Sometimes the level of guilt you are experiencing is warranted and is associated with aspects of the situation for which you are responsible for (your portion of the pie!). In these situations, guilt is appropriate and helpful because it indicates that you are behaving in a way that is not consistent with your values (e.g., John yelling at his wife when he values respectful communication). So how do you cope and move on when you have made a mistake or done something that you regret?"
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,6,"Strategies to manage guilt, including examining unhelpful thoughts and weighing personal responsibility.","Strategy 1: Learn from the mistake
It is unrealistic to expect that you will never do anything that bothers, hurts, or offends another person or that you'll never do something that goes against your values. So, the first step in coping with appropriate guilt is to accept that everyone has regrets and that making mistakes is part of being human. Unfortunately, when people are feeling low, they tend to dwell on these mistakes and have trouble moving on. This is where guilt and shame creep in. So, instead of dwelling on the past, try looking at the mistake as a learning opportunity. How can you handle the situation differently next time? What did you learn about yourself or someone else? Rather than continuing to punish yourself for something in the past, view this as a growth experience that will help you make better choices in the future."
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,7,,"Strategy 2: Self-forgiveness

Another important strategy in managing healthy guilt is to learn to forgive ourselves when we have made a mistake. We experience guilt and shame when we believe these mistakes make us bad people. Remember, making a mistake does not wipe out all of your positive qualities or undo other good deeds. Forgiveness involves recognizing that everyone has good and bad qualities and accepting yourself with these imperfections. Forgiveness also involves learning to talk to yourself in a kind and compassionate way (“I yelled at my wife because I was tired and overwhelmed” rather than “I yelled at my wife because I’m an awful person”)."
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,8,,"Strategy 3: Make amends

If you have caused harm to another person, then it might be helpful to make amends for your actions. Taking responsibility for your mistakes can help you to deal directly with the situation rather than getting stuck in feelings of guilt and shame. You can make amends by apologizing for a past behavior or finding out what you can do to repair the hurt or damage you caused. Even if you can’t repair a specific relationship, you can make amends by finding some way to make a positive contribution to the world (e.g., volunteer, offer support to someone else). Everyday we are confronted with choices, so use this as an opportunity to behave with more honesty and integrity in the present and future!"
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,9,Overcoming Guilt: Weighing Personal Responsibility,"A common type of unhelpful thinking that is related to guilt is overestimating personal responsibility. When people are feeling down or depressed, they tend to take more than their share of responsibility for the bad things that happen, and discount other contributing factors. An important step in attacking unhealthy guilt is to weigh how much of the situation was your sole responsibility and how much can be attributed to other people or circumstances of the situation."
Lesson #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,10,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Guilt is a common reaction when people feel like they’ve done something wrong. Sometimes guilt is appropriate and can tell us when we need to try to correct a mistake we’ve made. Other times, however, the guilt we feel is too extreme or we have thoughts about what making a mistake means about ourselves. In these times, it’s helpful to learn from the mistake and attempt to make amends. We can also determine how much the situation is truly related to our responsibility.  

Moving forward: Practice managing your feelings of guilt and shame by using the tools on the site.  "
Summary #16: Managing Guilt and Shame,1,,"Guilt is a common reaction when a person feels like they’ve done something wrong. Guilt can be unhealthy when it is too intense or lasts too long based on what you’ve done or when it results in unhealthy behaviors. Shame is like guilt, but involves not only feelings of regrets after a mistake but also a belief that the mistake means something about you as a person. People usually experience guilt when they think ""I did something wrong"". Typically the behavior is labeled as ""wrong"" because it is inconsistent with certain standards we have set for ourselves. Feelings of shame are a more extreme form of guilt and can be very damaging to a person’s self-esteem. Like guilt, shame is related to a belief that you have done something wrong. Shame indicates that not only do you believe you made a mistake, but that the mistake is a reflection of the kind of person you are. Three strategies can help you manage guilt and shame:

1.  Learn from the mistake: How can you handle the situation differently next time?  Rather than continuing to punish yourself for something in the past, view this as a growth experience that will help you make better choices in the future.

2.  Self-forgiveness: Making a mistake does not make you a bad person.  It makes you human.  Practice forgiving yourself and talking to yourself in a kind and compassionate way.

3.  Make amends: Taking responsibility for your mistakes can help you to deal directly with situation rather than getting stuck in feelings of guilt and shame. You can make amends by apologizing for a past behavior or finding out what you can do to repair the hurt or damage you caused. "
Lesson #17: Improving Personal Relationships,1,,"Stress can negatively impact our relationships. When we’re feeling stressed we might avoid others and focus more strongly on the negative aspects of our interactions with other people. Additionally, we may act in ways that lead to less enjoyable interpersonal interactions. One way to feel better is to increase the number and quality of our positive interactions with other people.

In this lesson you’ll learn:
-    How loneliness affects how you behave   

-    How your interactions with others may have changed as a result of your mood

-    How to better engage with the people around you"
Lesson #17: Improving Personal Relationships,2,How does depression affect my relationships?,"When people are stressed or feel down, they often interact differently with people. They tend to talk about more depressing subjects or ignore positive comments made by others. Low mood may also result in people communicating differently - they don't make eye contact or they may speak more softly. Because of these differences, other people often respond differently to a person who is feeling bad.  This means that when someone is down, they frequently aren't getting the kind of support they most need. By becoming aware of the process of interaction, you can improve your relationships.

"
Lesson #17: Improving Personal Relationships,3,The Need for Human Connection,"Humans are social creatures. When people rate what pleasures contribute most to a sense of happiness, they place love, intimacy and social affiliation above other things, including fame, wealth and even physical health.  Everyone has felt lonely or disconnected at some point – being in a place where you don’t know anyone, the break up of a relationship and so on. But feeling lonely too often can lead to a change in how we think about the people around us and how we behave with them. When we feel lonely, we view others through that lens – often times, other people seem more critical, competitive or unfriendly than they may actually be.  Because of this, a lonely person often ends up feeling defensive. This may make them feel less able to interact in a way that may actually help make connections and lessen the loneliness. Everyone has a unique way of interacting with the people around them. However, research has shown that when people are down, they generally interact differently through both their words and their actions."
Lesson #17: Improving Personal Relationships,4,The WHAT of Negative Communication,"When people are down, they tend to talk about different things and the focus of their conversations can be more negative. On a basic level, WHAT people talk about changes as their mood changes.

Do you ever?:
-    Find yourself talking about negative themes like how bad the weather is or how terrible your day was?
-    Catch yourself highlighting negatives in the situation?
-    Realize that you are ""Discounting the Positive"" or making disparaging comments about yourself or other people?
-    Often tell others about negative experiences that may have befallen you?
-    Require frequent self-assurance from your friends, family, or peers?
-    Communicate in an over-critical or hostile way?
 
Remember, always falling into some of these patterns can cause other people to be uncomfortable and to limit interactions."
Lesson #17: Improving Personal Relationships,5,The HOW of negative communication:,"In addition to WHAT a person is saying, the way they communicate can also make it difficult for others to get close to them. They may:
 
-    Pause longer and more often when speaking
-    Converse in a monotone voice
-    Speak less, more quietly and more slowly
-    Have less variation in facial expression
-    Use few nonverbal communications like hand gestures and eye contact
 
The good news is that some of the ""HOW"" of communication does improve as one's mood improves. When your mood improves, you smile more frequently, make better eye contact and speak with more animation. These are also skills that can be practiced and learned (see the Communication Skills lesson for more tips!). Both the ""HOW"" and the ""WHAT"" of communication can be improved by monitoring your interactions with others and trying to improve in these areas."
Lesson #17: Improving Personal Relationships,6,Communication skills improve with practice,"Step 1) Practice alone
Eventually, you'll need to try talking with other people to really perfect your skills. But as a warm up before the main event, try observing yourself in the mirror. It will probably feel funny at first, but it's OK to feel silly! (In fact, this helps!) If you need help starting, try describing the room you're standing in. Try it with a range of facial expressions and voice tones - be happy, nervous, bored, change up your posture by standing up straight or crossing your arms (maybe even try being a little silly!). Remember, this is how OTHER people see you--notice how it changes the way you come across!
 
Step 2) Practice with close friends or peers
Either you've felt too silly to try practicing in front of the mirror, or it's time to actually practice with a real person. The safest way to do this is in a risk-free setting with someone you're comfortable with.
 
Step 3) Practice with strangers
As you've probably noticed, it's easier to practice when the risk is lower. Before interacting with people you have to relate to every day, try these skills out on strangers who aren't involved in your day-to-day life."
Lesson #17: Improving Personal Relationships,7,After practicing... try it out!,"Once you've practiced recognizing these communication problems and developed some of your own skills, we'd like for you to try and notice your own communication habits! Please use the Activity Tracker to schedule an activity where you will talk with someone. Ask yourself: What did you notice about the interaction?  Did you catch yourself focusing on the negative?  Was it harder than you expected to not ""Discount the Positive""? Continue to notice your style and content of communication and practice positive interactions!  If your thoughts are tripping up your interaction, try the Thought Tracker."
Lesson #17: Improving Personal Relationships,8,Wrapping Up,"Summary: When you’re depressed you might have more negative contacts and fewer positive contacts with others. Many people, when they feel depressed, tend to isolate themselves from others and the communications they do have are sometimes more conflictual. Interpersonal contact is another form of positive activities and working on skills to improve one’s relationships is a useful tool to manage depression.   

Moving forward: We’ve discussed several steps to practicing positive relationship skills. Use your Activity Tracker to plan a time to practice these skills by yourself and with another person. Within the next week, plan at least 1 positive activity with another person. Use this time as an opportunity to practice your relationship skills. You can even tag the event with the tag “relationships” if you want.  "
Summary #17: Improving Personal Relationships,1,,"Stress can negatively impact our relationships. When we’re feeling stressed we might avoid others and focus more strongly on the negative aspects of our interactions with other people. Additionally, we may act in ways that lead to less enjoyable interpersonal interactions. One way to feel better is to increase the number and quality of our positive interactions with other people. 
 
When people are down, they tend to talk about different things and the focus of their conversations can be more negative.  In addition to what a person is saying, the way they communicate can also make it difficult for others to get close to them in that they pause longer, speak in a monotone voice and have less nonverbal communications like changes in facial expression and eye contact."
Lesson #18: Communication Skills,1,,"Good communication is the foundation for making and maintaining relationships. Most people have a sense of what good communication is. But knowing something and using it to your benefit can be two different things. In this lesson, our goal is to present these skills in a simple, organized way, that will help you make the most out of using them.

In this lesson you’ll learn:
-    How to improve your communication skills
-    How to use body language effectively
-    How to break the ice and start a conversation"
Lesson #18: Communication Skills,2,First Impressions: Body Language,"The foundation of good communication is body language. Research has shown that in a typical conversation, about half of our communication is non-verbal. Most first impressions are non-verbal, so it's important to start a conversation off in the right way. Body language can also help keep a conversation going. We're going to get started by identifying several important areas of non-verbal communication."
Lesson #18: Communication Skills,3,,"The main components of body language that help a conversation are:
-    Smiling
-    Nodding
-    Having an open stance
-    Leaning
-    Using eye contact

Let’s go through each of these."
Lesson #18: Communication Skills,4,Body Language: Use your Head (Literally!),"Smile
This is the easiest thing you can do to make yourself open and approachable to others. We don’t mean pretending to be happy all the time or looking phony. But a simple smile can make you feel better and other people treat you in a more friendly way. Smiling at another person sends a friendly signal to those around you that you are interested in who they are and what they have to say.

Nod
Nodding your head during a conversation signals that you are listening. It is a non-verbal way of demonstrating interest and encouraging the person to continue talking."
Lesson #18: Communication Skills,5,Body Language: Use your body,"Open Stance
-  Open arms and body posture are another cue to people that you are open to conversation.
-  Keeping your arms and/or legs tightly crossed or your body hunched over with shoulders tense sends the message that you are closed off or defensive.
-  Standing or sitting up straight with shoulders back and leaving your arms uncrossed helps people know that you are friendly and approachable.
-  For some of us, crossing arms or legs is a habit.
-  It can be helpful to put yourself in a posture that makes it impossible to cross your arms and legs: For example, put one hand in a pants pocket, or keep both your feet on the ground when sitting. Keeping an open stance will make other people more comfortable with you. And it may make you feel more comfortable too!"
Lesson #18: Communication Skills,6,Breaking the Ice,"Say hello first. It may seem risky but what is the worst that can happen? It’s a pretty minor risk for the potential pay off of being friendly with someone you know, or making or developing a new acquaintance. Being the first to approach gives you more power to direct the conversation. You can also make an effort to look for people who are giving signs that they are open to conversation – smiling and looking friendly, open posture and so on – to increase the odds that your hello will be rewarded with a conversation. Try to remember something about the person. If you know the person, start the conversation with a question about something you remember about them."
Lesson #18: Communication Skills,7,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Good communication skills are the foundation of good relationships. Fortunately, like most things in life, communication skills can be improved through practice. Using body language successful is an important way to communicate interest. In order to gain more practice with effective communication, it’s useful to break the ice and say hello first.

Moving forward: The best way to improve your communication skills is to practice them. Use your Activity Tracker to plan a time to practice these skills by scheduling an activity where other people will be present. This may be a work party, a social event hosted by a friend, or a completely new activity. If it’s a new activity, it’s best to pick something that you’re interested in, because people who go to that event will likely be interested in the same things as you and be open to talk about that. Within the next week, plan at least 1 activity to practice these skills. You can even tag the event with the tag “relationships” if you want.  "
Summary #18: Communication Skills,1,,"Good communication is the foundation for making and maintaining relationships. Most people have a sense of what good communication is. But knowing something and using it to your benefit can be two different things. The foundation of good communication is body language.  This includes things like smiling, nodding, having an open stance, leaning in to the other person and using eye contact.  Try starting a conversation with others to practice.  Look for people who appear open to chatting. Try to stick to open ended questions to keep the conversation going and use “ritual questions,” which are easy requests for information such as “How do you know the people at this party?”  It may seem a little intimidating at first to start a conversation but practice makes it easier!
 "
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,1,,"Assertive communication is speaking in a way that is calm, honest, and respectful to the other person and works towards helping both people get their needs met. Assertive communication is just one style of communication, but it is often the most effective. Learning to express oneself in an assertive way increases the chances that you will get what you want and decreases the chances that you will have to do something that you don’t want to do.

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
    -Different types of communication styles – passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, and assertive.
    -How to develop an assertive message.
    -How to handle different responses to assertive communication."
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,2,What is assertiveness and why is it helpful to be assertive?,"Humans are social creatures. We need relationships with others. While relationships are very important to our well-being, even the best relationship can cause stress. Negotiating our wants, desires and needs, as well as sharing our frustrations and affections, requires effective communication and often, assertiveness. Being assertive is an honest and appropriate expression of one's thoughts, emotions and needs."
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,3,"Different types of communication styles – passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, and assertive.","Communication can be especially difficult when some sort of conflict or disagreement is present or anticipated.
Situations with the potential for conflict can be approached in one of four ways:
- Passive communication and aggressive communication are two extreme ways to interact

-Aggressive communication puts your rights above those of the listener. It means focusing on “getting your way” or “having your say” rather than respecting the concerns of the other person or helping them understand your concerns

-Passive communication puts the rights and needs of others above your own. It means tending to keep your thoughts and opinions to yourself rather than expressing your concerns. You may not say anything when something bothers you and have trouble standing up for what you want or need.

-Passive-aggressive communication is a problematic combination of the two styles that results in no one getting their needs met. It frequently involves doing something that will cause irritation to the other person but offering a plausible excuse. It is a way of communicating negative or resentful feelings in an unassertive way. Some examples include being late and making people wait and not following through on things you promise to do. This type of communication can be particularly damaging because it causes irritation but doesn't leave any opportunity to correct the situation. Neither person gets the results they want.

-Assertive communication provides a healthy middle ground—you express positive or negative feelings and/or thoughts calmly, honestly, and respectfully to the other person. In doing so, the needs of both individuals can be met"
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,4,,"An aggressive person often wants to have the last word and tries to overpower others in a conversation.

A passive person often says nothing and does not express their needs.

A passive-aggressive person combines the two styles in a way that usually results in no one getting their needs met.

An assertive person expresses their feelings, thoughts, wants, and needs calmly, honestly, and respectfully. Although an assertive person does not always get what they want, assertive communication increases the chances that you will be able to have your needs met and decreases the chances that you will be forced to do something you do not want to do."
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,5,,"It can often be difficult to be assertive about your needs, especially when you are not feeling your best. Perhaps you just don’t have the energy to talk about your needs or you may not believe that you deserve to get what you want. Unhelpful thoughts may make it
harder to be assertive, however, with some practice it gets easier to find that middle ground in communication."
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,6,The Three Part Assertion Method,"Although we are often told we can’t expect to change the way other people behave, there are times when telling someone else their behavior is upsetting is appropriate.  There are also times when standing up for your rights and needs is necessary.

Using the three part assertion message makes this easier: Behavior + Feelings + Effects

Here's an example of a good three part assertion message: ""When the dirty dishes are left on the counter, I feel upset because it makes more work for me.""

Compare this to the other styles of communicating the same information:
Aggressive: ""I hate it when you leave dirty dishes on the counter! What's wrong with you?!""
Passive: Not saying anything
Passive-Aggressive: Not saying anything about the dishes and instead letting them pile up

Notice that the assertive message is respectful and clearly describes the issue and the reason for your feelings while not pointing fingers or being rude."
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,7,,"Let's look at each part of the assertive statement: Behavior + Feelings + Effects

Behavior
""When the dirty dishes are left on the counter, I feel upset because it makes more work for me.""

The first part of the message involves a non-judgemental description of the behavior. Do not assume the other person knows what the problem is. Try to explain the problem behavior in a way that does not point fingers. Do not make inferences about the other person’s motives or character. Simply describe the behavior in clear terms.

A good problem description should be:

- Specific
- Strictly behavioral – no inferences about motive, attitude, or character
- Objective, not subjective
- Avoid imperatives like ""should"" or ""must""
- Short and to the point"
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,8,,"Feelings
""When the dishes are left dirty on the counter, I feel upset because it makes more work for me.""

The second part of the assertion message involves the disclosure of genuine emotion. This means gauging your emotion and sharing the accurate degree of your feelings. Exaggerations of emotion often don’t ring true and can diminish the effect of your statement. If you are only upset about the dirty dishes, say that. Don’t say you are furious. Although it may seem like a stronger emotion gives your statement more power, if the statement feels like an exaggeration, the other person is less likely to take it seriously.

A good feeling statement should be:
- Genuine
- Have the appropriate degree of feeling – don’t say furious when you’re only annoyed
- Avoid judgmental feelings – i.e. ""I feel unfairly treated"" not ""I feel abused"""
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,9,,"Effects
“When the dishes are left dirty on the counter, I feel upset because it makes more work for me.”

This is your chance to explain how the other person’s behavior effects you. People are often more motivated to change when they can understand how their behavior is negatively impacting someone important to them. Describe the concrete effect the behavior has on your life.

A good effects statement should:

-Not impose your values on the other person.
- States the real effect, not one that “sounds better.”"
Lesson #19: Assertiveness,10,,"Summary: By being assertive and expressing what you want and how you feel in a respectful way, you can improve your relationships with others. Being assertive manages your mood and your life by allowing you to choose when and where to express how you think and feel. The three part assertive method (Behavior + Feelings + Effects) is a helpful way to create assertive messages.  

Moving forward: The best way to improve your communication skills is to practice them. Use your Activity Tracker to plan a time to practice assertive communication. Just about any activity can help you use assertiveness skills. If it seems hard at first, you can practice by writing out some examples of three-part messages (Behavior + Feelings + Effects). Within the next week, plan at least 1 activity to practice these skills. You can even tag the event with the tag “relationships” if you want.  If you feel anxious about being assertive, that would be a great emotion to work through on the Thought Tracker."
Summary #19: Assertiveness,1,,"Negotiating our wants, desires and needs, as well as sharing our frustrations and affections, requires effective communication and often, assertiveness. Being assertive is an honest and appropriate expression of one's thoughts, emotions and needs.

Passive Communication: Person puts respect for the rights and needs of others above his own. Communicating passively means you tend to keep your thoughts and opinions to yourself.

3. Effects: Describe the CONCRETE effect the person's behavior has on your life."
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,1,,"Everyone has a handful of strengths that define who they are. Strengths are not skills, but instead are characteristics of who you are at your best. This includes things such as curiosity, kindness, and perseverance. People can get more satisfaction out of life if they learn to identify the strengths they process and then use them as much as possible in life.

In this lesson you’ll learn:
-    How to identify your individual strengths and values
-    How to recognize how you use your strengths and values in your life
-    How to express your strengths and values in your daily activities in new ways"
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,2,,"During the times that you feel down or depressed, your emotions can undermine your self-esteem and sense that you are living a positive, meaningful life.

We are also bombarded with messages that “success” in life is related to your job title, money, or other symbols of accomplishment. But scientific research is confirming what philosophers and spiritual leaders have been saying for centuries: that the key to happiness and meaning in your life is finding your own unique way of expressing your individual strengths and values in your life. It’s not about where you end up, but how you live each day.

"
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,3,What Makes People Happy,"When people are asked about what they think makes them happy, many will talk about a desire for material possessions or a wish to not have to work. But research shows that when people get these things, they are not necessarily happier. Even lottery winners only experience an increase in positive feelings for a few months, and then their mood returns to whatever it was before they won. When you ask older people - people who have the experience of having lived most of their lives - what really mattered to them, they will give you a different answer. They will say that they are grateful to have been a loving parent, a caring wife or husband, a loyal friend. They will be happier that they spent time painting or writing, and feel good about helping people in their community after a devastating fire or flood. Their answers are more about how they lived, what they gave or created, or how connected they felt to others.

"
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,4,How to Live Your Strengths & Values,"The ancient Greek Philosopher Aristotle defined what he believed is the “good life.” He believed that a person can only achieve true happiness by realizing his or her own unique essence or potential. This lesson is about helping you to do just that! In Step 1 you'll identify your particular strengths. Step 2 will help you realize where in your life you are already expressing your unique strengths. Step 3 will guide you in finding new ways of living your strengths and values in your daily routines, in order to create more meaning and purpose in your life."
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,5,What is a Unique Strength?,"Every individual has their own set of unique strengths that...
    ...are core features of your personality (such as generosity, optimism, being a good parent or a good friend, love of learning, desire to help others, or creativity and more
    ...when expressed in your daily life, make you feel energized, lifted up and fulfilled.
    ...come naturally to you.
    ...you feel genuine when you use your unique strengths.
    ...are what you deeply value in yourself and the world."
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,6,What Unique Strengths are Not,"They are not specific skills such as mathematical or writing ability, carpentry or computer skill. They are not goals such as obtaining a job, buying a car, reaching a certain income or obtaining a degree. They are not accomplishments like winning an award, getting a promotion, or being recognized in some way at work/school. They are not something you did in the past, or what you are trying to achieve in the future. You already possess your unique strengths inside yourself, even if you are not expressing them frequently in your life right now.

"
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,7,Step 1: Identifying Your Strengths,"Identifying your strengths may come immediately to you, or it may take some time to figure out. We’re going to have you take an initial stab at it. But don’t worry: you don’t have to “get it right” today – you can always modify your unique strengths later. Before we get started, it’s important to realize that during the times you feel down, identifying your strengths can be difficult. Depression and negative mood often diminishes your positive sense of self. You may have difficulty thinking about what you are good at, or what you value about yourself. If you are having difficulty as you try to identify your strengths, try to think back to how you viewed yourself before feeling down, or imagine what someone else would say about you."
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,8,Step 2: Realizing How You Already Use Your Strengths,"Often we are focused on what isn’t going well in our lives. We look back at our past and have regrets, or we focus on chasing some goal we feel we should achieve in the future. What is harder is to recognize what we have right now—the positive qualities in ourselves that we always carry with us and use each day. It’s important, especially when you are feeling down, to recognize that you still have your own special way of expressing yourself. You always carry your strengths and values with you. When people identify their unique strengths, they are often surprised to realize that they use these strengths regularly in their daily lives—in how they approach their work, have fun or relate to others. As you think about your unique strengths--it helps to think about ways you already use them in your daily life."
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,9,Step 3: Expanding Your Use of Strengths,"There are two approaches to finding ways to use your strengths more often in your life. They involve:

1) Coming up with ideas about how you could bring more of your strengths to activities you are already doing. For example, if one of your strengths is leadership, but you are not in a supervisory role at work, you might think of ways you could bring leadership to an existing activity like organizing a social or volunteer event that brings the office closer together.

2) Imagining new activities that would allow you to use your strengths. For example, if one of your strengths is creativity, you could take a writing class or set aside time at home to start a project (painting, playing music, designing something.)"
Lesson #20: Living Your Strengths and Values,10,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Many people want to be happy. However, the things people often think will make them happy (e.g., money, a bigger house, a fancy car) often do not promote long-term happiness. Instead, happiness comes from using your strengths and values in your life as much as possible. Strengths are not skills, goals, or accomplishments. Strengths are aspects of yourself like honesty, creativity, kindness, that define who you are. By identifying and using your strengths as much as possible and in new ways, you can live a happier, healthier life.   

Moving forward: You can use the Activity Tracker to schedule more activities related to your strengths. Over the next three days schedule 1 activity a day that relates to one of your strengths. You can even tag these events with the specific strength you are using. Try to use these strengths in a way that you have not before. You might use your strengths in a new setting or with a new person."
Summary #20: Living your Strengths and Values,1,,"This lesson is about identifying your unique strengths, realizing where in your life you are already expressing them, and finding new ways of living your strengths and values in your daily routines. This will help you create more meaning and purpose in your life.

Step 1: Identifying Your Strengths
Every individual has their own set of unique strengths that are core features of your personality, make you feel energized and fulfilled, come naturally to you, make you feel genuine, and are what you deeply value in yourself and the world. You already possess your unique strengths inside yourself, even if you are not expressing them frequently in your life right now.

Step 2: Realizing How You Already Use Your Strengths
As you think about your unique strengths--it helps to think about ways you already use them in your daily life. It is also important to find new ways of expressing your strengths and scheduling those activities as part of your day-to-day life.

Step 3: Expanding Your Use of Strengths
There are two approaches to finding ways to use your strengths more often in your life. 1) Coming up with ideas about how you could bring more of your strengths to activities you are already doing. 2) Imagining new activities that would allow you to use your strengths."
Final Lesson #21: Moving forward...,1,,"Overcoming depression involves changing what you do. You’ve learned many ways to change including changing your behaviors and your thoughts to adopt more healthy ways of living. To maintain the gains you’ve made you need to keep up these new ways of acting and thinking. Fortunately, you’ve learned many new skills to help you do this throughout these lessons.

In this lesson we'll talk about:
-    What you've learned so far
-    How to pull it all together
-    Where to go from here"
Final Lesson #21: Moving forward...,2,,"You have completed all of the lessons in the “ThinkFeelDo” program! So far, you've learned about how behavior and thoughts affect your mood. You've also learned to use a variety of tools to help take control over your mood and manage symptoms. The tools will continue to be available for you to use.
 
Let's review what you've done so far..."
Final Lesson #21: Moving forward...,3,It's what you do!,"In the first ThinkFeelDo lessons, you learned how increasing the amount of time you spend doing things that are enjoyable and give you a sense of accomplishment can help you begin to feel better. The Activity Tracker is intended to help you begin to make sure you are doing things that you enjoy, that give you a sense of accomplishment, and that will help you begin to feel better."
Final Lesson #21: Moving forward...,4,It's what you think!,"You've also completed the lessons that help you change how you think. As we've discussed, unhelpful thoughts can lead to feelings of distress.  However, by learning to identify your thoughts and challenging the unhelpful ones, you can take control over your mood. Over time, learning to challenge and change the way you think will help you to feel better. The Thought Tracker is designed to help you notice and keep track of your thoughts, to identify any “Thought Distortions,” and to generate more realistic and balanced alternative ways of thinking."
Final Lesson #21: Moving forward...,5,Managing your Symptoms,"Many of the tools in ThinkFeelDo involve logging symptoms.  Although this may seem tedious at times, the more information you have about symptoms and what may impact them, the better you can make changes.  This technique applies to many different symptoms and behaviors, so don't forget about the benefit of noticing your symptoms or behaviors and what helps to change them!"
Final Lesson #21: Moving forward...,6,Now what?,"Our goal is to help you to integrate these changes into your life, so that you can live with more enjoyment and satisfaction.  To do that, you have started to change behaviors and thoughts that have been with you for a long time. Change doesn't happen overnight. And it takes time to integrate these new ways of behaving and thinking into your life. 

"
Final Lesson #21: Moving forward...,7,Thanks for completing the lessons on ThinkFeelDo!,"Just because you have finished all the lessons, it doesn't mean there isn't anything for you to do! All of the tools will be available for you to continue to use, so please keep coming!"
Final Lesson #21: Moving forward...,8,Wrapping Up,"Summary: Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected. By changing the way we think and act we can gain more control over our feelings and our lives. Throughout these lessons you’ve learned many useful skills to increase the number of positive activities and helpful thoughts you experience. You’ve done a great thing for yourself by reading these lessons and completing this program and you should be proud of everything you’ve accomplished. It’s often hard for people to celebrate yourself but you should take the time to celebrate everything you’ve done.  

Moving forward: You can continue to use the tools we’ve created to help you deal with stressful situations and increase positive experiences in your life. You can also practice these skills without the tools. Just remember that if you feel better you should continue to practice these skills and if your mood starts to slip again you can practice them even more frequently.  "
